## Whatâ€™s New

### People Occlusion 

- Available on A12 and later
- Two ways: 
  - people fragmentation (AR experience will always be occluded by people, regardless of the distance of AR objects and people)
  - people fragmentation + depth (ARKit estimate the people distance and occluded objects/people based on that)

### Motion Capture

- Tracks Human Body
- Two ways: 2D and 3D

### Collaborative Session

- Multiple devices can be used to merge POI together and create a big AR world
- Uses the [MultipeerConnectivity](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/multipeerconnectivity) framework for sharing AR World data or other wireless way to do so.

### AR Coaching UI

- To be used when telling the user to move the phone in the horizontal/vertical plane to start the AR experience
- Automatically hides/updates itself based on the AR state

### New Plane Classes

- Wall floor ceiling table seat door window (last two are new)

### Visual Coherence
