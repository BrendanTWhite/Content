Create ML Recommenders are a fantastic way to add personalization and intelligence into the user experience of our app. 

Recommenders work by looking for patterns in groups of items. 

Recommenders use a tabular approach:

Each row here says that a particular item belongs to a particular group. In this example the groups are recipes and the items are ingredients.

A rating is a measure of how good or how desirable a particular interaction is.

Now, when we throw all the items into the mix, the Recommender builds a graph of which items tend to go with which other items. How they're all related.

And it's this _graph_ that gets packaged into our model. 

All of the user data and the group data present in our training data is not explicitly present in the final model.
