## Collaborative Session

- In short, each device creates their own points cloud, and share this with the other devices.
- Once the devices find an overlapping in their points cloud, the two scenes can be merged together.
- It is important to use ARAnchors, because those are automatically translated between devices (each device keeps using their own anchors, but they need to make sense of other devices anchors)

## ARAnchor Best Practice for Multi-User AR

- `ARParticipantAnchor` lets you know where the other users in the experience are.
- `ARAnchors` are the main way to share virtual content within collaborative session.
- Respond to ARAnchor updatesduring a session the anchor position can change (when arkit knows the scene better), make sure that the virtual objects update their position as well
- Place 3d content nearby ranchers (not too far away)
- If you have multiple independent objects, it’s wise to attach them to multiple different ARAnchors in the map

## SwiftStrike — A New Multiplayer AR Experience

The last part of the session talks about a new AR open source game made by Apple, it’s very nice to see its comparison with last year’s slingshot AR game: thanks to people occlusion, RealityKit, and ARKit 3 enhancements (especially around collaborative session) there’s a lot less code to be written by developers and the experience is way better.
