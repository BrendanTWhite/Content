## `po`, Print Object Description

- Textual representation of the instance at hand. 
- The runtime system provides a default representation, however we can customize it for any type by conforming to the [`CustomDebugStringConvertible`][customDoc] protocol.

- Conforming to this protocol changes only the top level description of that type (not the nested properties)
- `po` is actually an alias to `expression --object-description`

## `p`, print 

- In `p` we can see that the result of the expression is assigned to a `$Rx` value that later we can use to reference that object in our debugging.

## `v`, frame variable

- `v` doesn’t compile any code, and has a different syntax than the language that you’re debugging

## `po` vs. `p` vs. `v`
