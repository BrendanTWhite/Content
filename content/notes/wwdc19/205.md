Better iPad apps make better Mac apps, however better UIKitForMac apps contain refinement specifically for Macs.

## macOS vs iOS Technology Stack

## macOS apps vs iOS simulator apps (on macOS) Technology Stack

## macOS apps vs UIKitForMac apps Technology Stack

## Catalyst goals

- Easy to get started (one check box in project)
- One project, one source base, one target (no forks, code duplication etc)
- iPad app on the inside (runs on UIKit)
- Mac app on the outside (best macOS experience)

## What happens when we tick on the “Mac” check box:

- We have “My Mac” among our targets
- A new label under the bundle identifier: this is the Mac bundle identifier which is identical to the iOS one, but with `uikitformac.` prefix.
- New macOS-specific capabilities are enabled like:
  - outgoing connections (which iOS apps get for free). 
  - other capabilities are automatically enabled based on our usage description in the info.plist (like picture access, location)

- In `Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content` Xcode will automatically enable frameworks based on their availability on each platform.

## XCFrameworks

Binary frameworks need to be recompiled for UIKit apps for Macs.

That’s why Apple has released XCFframeworks: 
`.xcframeworks` allow library developers to package a library from multiple platforms into a single distributable bundle that developer can use in their Xcode projects.

## MacOS Icon

For adding a macOS icon, all we need to do is check the “Mac” target in the inspector when the appIcon asset is selected: if we don’t do so the Mac app will get the iOS icon, which is very unMac-like.

## Things we get for free

- If we have settings in the `settings.app`, those will be automatically mapped to a Preference menu and will be displayed with a proper macOS style:

- Touch Bar gets filled with elements from AVPlayer and suggested words from UITextFields.
- `UIDocumentPickerViewController` get automatically translated to the macOS file picker
- Copy and paste 
- Drag and drop 
- Printing
- Multiple windows 
- Application lifecycle

## Things that get ported as-is

In Apple words: 

”Trying to give apps full AppKit controls and metrics with represent too much of a disruption. So, individually, UIKit controls and layouts based on them come across as is providing maximal compatibility for your app.“

Therefore:

- UIControls
- Custom views

All look exactly the same in catalyst apps as if they were running on iOS.

## No custom interaction porting.

## Availability

When checking for availability, e.g. `@available(iOS 8.0)`, will automatically translate to UIKitForMac as well. 

However, if we want to make something available only on UIKitForMac apps, we can explicitly say so: 

```swift
@available(macOS 10.10, UIKitForMac 13.0) @unavailable(iOS, watchOS, tvOS) 
```

Or viceversa:

```swift
@available(macOS 10.10, iOS 8.0, watchOS 2.0, tvOS 9.0) @unavailable(UIKitForMac) 
```

## Bundle Format

Hardcoding paths is bad, hardcoding paths on `UIKitForMac` simply doesn’t work as the bundle of the same app will be different in each platform. Use `NSBundle` APIs instead.
