- RealityKit is a brand new Swift framework designed to help you build your AR applications and easily exploit the power of ARKit.
- Reality Composer is a Mac and iOS tool that enables simple AR-based content creation. 
- With Reality Kit we can add audio to our models as well: the audio will play louder the closer we go to that model.
- New file format: Reality File. Optimized for RealityKit

## RealityKit Basics

### ARView

- Your window to the view of AR, entry point for RealityKit
- Itâ€™s a view, therefore it goes with our view hierarchy
- Sets up the environment (shadowing, environment reflections, camera noise especially a night added to AR models as well)
- Handles gestures
- Focus on the app 
- Realistic camera effects (bokeh, motion blur)

### Anchor

- Describes how AR objects relate to the real world
- Same Anchoring support as in ARKit
- Owned by the Scene 

### Scene

- Holds the AR content of the app
- Owned by ARview

### Entity

- Building block of every AR object 
- This is the AR content
- Establishes scene structure 
- Provides transform hierarchy
- Owned by the Anchor
