## Sensors

Our devices have tons of sensors:

## What is an Activity Classification? 

Activity Classification is a task that allows us to recognize our pre-defined set of physical actions that the user does with their devices.

In the session, the presenter shows us an example of a Fressbee throws classifier.

An example of activity data (it’s a csv table with time stamps and `x, y, z` values):

In Create ML we can filter which axis of which acceleration/rotation we should consider for the training, we can also define a Prediction Window Size to let Create ML know how much is the size of the sample to analyze (this way we can have multiple gestures/measurements in one table).

## Best practices

- Use relevant sensor for your motion (understand your motion)
- Collect irrelevant motions as “other”, to avoid false positive
- Provide balanced classes (same number of samples for each class/category)
- Provide raw data instead of processed device motion data
