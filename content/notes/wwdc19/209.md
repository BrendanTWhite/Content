Core ML 3 runs **entirely on device**, is hardware accelerated (neural networks), and can update models locally as well.

Domains updates (reminder: all of this runs on device now):

## Vision Updates

- Image classification
- Image Similarity
- Face Capture Quality
- Human Detection
- Object Saliency: vision can figure out the main subject of a given image and let you know where it is in the image
- Attention Saliency
- Text Recognition
- Animal Detection
- Document Camera (Document recognition and auto OCR)
- Improved Object Tracker
- Improved Face Landmarks

## Natural Language Updates

- Sentiment Analysis: tells if a given phase is positive/negative etc.
- Word Embeddings: tells words similarity (topic-wise, e.g. cloudy and Thunderstorm)
- Text Catalogs
- Transfer Learning

## Speech and Sound Updates

- Speech Recognition
- Voice Analysis: beside telling you what has been spoken, voice analysis provides also how it is spoken (normal voice and more)

We can combine different CoreML Domains seamlessly, for example:  

- categorize images and assign tags to them
- use speech recognition to catalog text and find the images that match that categorization using word embeddings.

Improved compatibility with other ML creation tools (TensorFlow and others).

## Model Fine-Tuning on device

- It is now possible to create personalized model per each user, privacy, no server costs.
- This can be done in the background (see `BackgroundTasks` framework).
