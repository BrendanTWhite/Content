## Apple School Manager (ASM) & Apple Business Manager (ABM) Update

- From this fall, custom apps will be available to ASM, too.
- Apple Deployment Program is being deprecated.
- Updated restrictions on macOS and iOS.
- On classroom the teacher can force the students devices to go back to the home screen from its device.

## Device Management Update

- tvOS feature parity with the other platforms
- New User Enrollment
- Better balance for BYOD 
- Protects privacy of personal data 
- Secures corporate data
- Separate Apple ID (for work) beside personal Apple ID. This secondary ID is created via ASM and ABM
- Apps have complete separate data for both Apple IDs, Notes and other support this, no idea how it works for 3rd party apps.
- An app managed (via work Apple ID) cannot become un-managed (transferred to the personal Apple ID
- When the enrollment ends, all the data of the work Apple ID is destroyed. There’s no way for the user to get the data because the data is accessed via a private key no longer known for the device user.
- BYOD cannot be wiped out by the business. The only “nuke” option is to stop the enrollment, which will remove all the data/apps of the work Apple ID: personal data is left untouched.
