## Time Profiler 

- uses infrastructure provided by the operating system to collect call stacks of relevant threads at a fixed interval.

## Points of Interest

- collects data from important areas of the app that we can highlight using various APIs such as Signpost API.

## Time Profile Template

- This template is used to profile both time and POI
- lets us add even more instruments to get more insights on the app.
- great tool for looking at issues that occur over a particular window of time.

## Track Viewer

![][trackViewerImage]
￼
- A Track shows time series trace data corresponding to one source of events, such as the process, thread, or CPU core.
- A single Instrument may contribute trace data to multiple Tracks.
- The top Track is a summary of our application's CPU utilization provided by the Time Profiler Instrument.
- Spinning is how Instruments refers to your main thread being blocked:

## Details View

![][detailsImage]

- allows to explore the trace data for the selected Track.
- when a time profiler trace is selected, it shows us a call graph: 
these are all the functions that were invoked during the time of the profile.

## Detail inspector
- When exploring the detail inspector (right column), we can click on a closure row to see it selected in the Detail view:

- Double clicking the closure in the inspector jumps right into the line of code in the source.

## Profiling tips

- If you have response issues, check the main thread in the time profile.
- profile in release mode

## Using Signposts

- More performant the print statements and the likes
- Natively supported by Instruments
- Has its own dedicated trace: Point of interestsThe POI trace shows a region of interest that corresponds to a Signpost interval that I added to my code.
