- We can now request MapKit Snapshots from web (snapshot = basically a screenshot)
- GeoJSON Support
- New Indoor Mapping Data Format, `IMDF`, to display lots of overlays in indoor areas.

## POI Improvements

Previously we could only choose map styles like `muted`, `hybrid`, `satellite`.  
The issue with these types is that mapKit still decides what POI (Point Of Interest) to display.  
Now, thanks to `MKPointOfInterestFilter` we have an option to filter these POI based on their kind (we can explicitly say which ones we want to include or which ones we do not want to include).

## Search Results.

MapKit There have been improvements in filtering results in search requests. Basically the same as POIs above: we can choose which kind of results we want back.

## Improve Overlay performance
New [`MKMultiPolyline`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit/mkmultipolyline) and [`MKMultiPolygon`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit/mkmultipolygon) with associated renderers: Overlays are now vector objects instead of bitmaps (can revert back to old behaviour if needed)

## Boundaries

- `MKMapView.CameraBoundary` we can limit the area of the map where the user can pan

- `MKMapView.CameraZoomRange` we can set the min/max distance from the center of the screen
