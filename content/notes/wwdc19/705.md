## iOS 13 Authorization Flow

New authorization flow for core location:
If the user presses not allow, that’s it (as before).

If we request _Always On_ authorization, `locationManager.requestAlwaysAuthorization()`, in iOS 13 the user gets this:

![][allowOnceImage]

Therefore, regardless if we ask for _when in use_ “only” or _always_, this is the pop up that the user will get.

However, if: 

- The app has asked for _Always On_
- The user has granted the most prominent option (_Allow While in Use_, as seen in the screenshot above)

At this point iOS will grant a provisional “_Always On_” authorization to our app, even when the user has tapped _Allow While in Use_.

At this point the app can act as if the real _Always On authorization_ has been granted.

When something happens that would require the _Always On_ authorization, **then and only then** iOS will request for that _Always Allow_ authorization in the app behalf:

![][alwaysAllowImage]

Then, and only then, both the app and the user will be on the same page.

## New in iOS 13

All core location APIs are available as long as any authorization is granted. 

From now on, the difference between “_When In Use_” and “_Always_” is that things can be started when the app is not in use if the “_Allow Always_” authorization has been granted.

## When is the app in use?

- When the app is in the foreground and for a few seconds after it has been put in the background (grace period).

- If we set to `true` the location manager property `allowsBackgroundLocationUpdates`, our app will be considered in use even after the app has been put in the background, and the blue status bar indicator will appear. 

- Watch complications are considered always in use.

Therefore, from iOS 13, even apps with only “_When In Use_” authorization can do background tracking.

## Allow Once

In iOS 13 ww also have a temporary _Allow Once_ authorization:  
from the app point of view, this will become a “_When In Use_” grant until the app is no longer in use, after which the authorization will go back to the “_not determined_” status. After which the app can once again ask for authorization.
