Users can now change the language setting per app, this is huge! 
Available both on macOS and iOS.

This setting is in the system setting, we can forward the user there by calling: `UIApplication.shared.open(URL(string: UIApplication.openSettingsURLString)!)`

Once the language has changed, the app will be relaunched with the new language preference.

## Device-specific strings

We now have `.stringsdict` for device-specific strings:  
this is awesome for iPad apps brought to Mac, because they can now display text like “tap here” and “click here” any without further logic required.

Dictionary Rule: `NSStringDeviceSpecificRuleType`
Values: `appletv`, `applewatch`, `ipad`, `iphone`, `ipod`, `mac`.

Localizable assets directly on the assets catalog (finally!)
