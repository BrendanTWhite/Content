- Like for activities, apps can now donate events. 
- E.g. a flight booking app can donate the booked flight event to the system to let iOS know when the user is flying.

- These events, for the moment, are limited to reservations, and theyâ€™re donated to the system in a form of intent (via the `Intent` framework).

- In case of flight apps, Siri can even suggest to check-in at the right time (if the app supports that). This is something that the app has to donate along, the app also specifies the correct time range where this is valid.

- This info is also used in maps to suggest where to go, and in a meeting to suggest to turn on do not disturb.

- What kind of reservations are supported?
  - Restaurant
  - Movies 
  - Ticketed Events
  - Car Rentals 
  - Train 
  - Hotels 
  - Flights

- We can also update a reservation (for example when the flight gate changes), or cancel a reservation (when the user cancels the booking).
