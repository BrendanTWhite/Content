New `SKStoreFront`, it lets us know what country the user is from, we can use it to sell targeted things to that user.

```swift
if let sf = SKPaymentQueue.default().storefront { 
  ...
}
```

It can be nil (the presenter didnâ€™t say how/why).

Use this to observe changes (e.g. when the user change store/account)

```swift
//MARK: - SKPaymentTransactionObserver methods 

func paymentQueueDidChangeStorefront(_ queue: SKPaymentQueue) { 
  ...
}
```
