## Three classes

- `XCUIApplication`
  - Proxy of the tested application, it launches the app (and kill any pre-existing instances of the app). 
  - You use this to query for XCUI Elements

- `XCUIElement`
  - Proxy for UI elements in the app. They have types (buttons, labels, ...) and identifiers (“new”, “add”, “delete”, ...).
  - You can simulate events (like taps) with these elements.
  - Every query to get a element must resolve to exactly one match (multiple or no matches will cause a failure)

- `XCUIElementQuery`
  - When querying, you can get elements via subscripting, via index, and if you know it’s just a one result, use unique.

## `UIRecorder`

- You can create a test just by hitting the record button, then interact in the app simulator. Every action is recorded and automatically added in the test for you.  

- What you’re validating this way is that the UI elements you’re interacting with exist during the test. 

- If you want to validate the states of different elements (like if a button has been tapped), you need to add more logic in the test yourself.

- You can even set a breakpoint in one test, hit the record button and add interactions to an already existing test.

- After running the tests, you can see the report to actually see each test step by step. You can even get a screenshot of that step in the reporter:

## Accessibility Inspector

After running this Xcode tool, you can press `⌘ + F7` to visualize in the simulator what element is under the cursor:
