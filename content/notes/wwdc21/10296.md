## Test repetitions

- new in Xcode 13
- allow you to repeat a test up to a specified number of iterations with a stopping condition

Three test repetition modes:

1. Fixed iterations
  - will repeat your tests a fixed number of times regardless of the outcome status
  - great for understanding the reliability of your test suite and helping keep it reliable as new tests are introduced over time

2. Until failure
  - will repeat a test until it fails
  - useful to reproduce a nondeterministic test failure to catch it in the debugger

3. Retry on failure
  - will retry your test until it succeeds up to a specified maximum
  - useful to identify unreliable tests which fail initially but eventually succeed on reattempt

To enable, either:

- specify the mode within a test plan
- control+click on a test diamond in your test file and choose the menu <kbd>Run "test...()" Repeatedlyâ€¦</kbd>
- on the terminal

```shell
xcodebuild test -project ....xcodeproj -scheme ... -destination '...' -test-iterations 100 -run-tests-until-failure
```

The `xcodebuild` test repetition flags are:

```shell
-test-iterations <number>
-retry-tests-on-failure
-run-tests-until-failure
```
