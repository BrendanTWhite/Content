Quick Note is a system-wide note-taking experience aimed to: 

- streamline the ability to take notes on iOS and macOS
- connect content from multiple apps and the web in one location

Uses `NSUserActivity`:

- When the user opens a quick note while in an app, the user will be able to add the user activity in the note
- If the user does an activity which was previously stored in a quick note, the system will show <kbd>Quick Note Suggestions</kbd>, prompting the user to open the quick note containing that `NSUserActivity` - Quick note suggestions work across devices/platforms
- the `NSUserActivity` added into the note should function as a deep link to let the user jump into that state in your app

## How it works

To appear on Quick Note, your `NSUserActivity` must set one or more of the following properties:

- `targetContentIdentifier`
- `persistentIdentifier`
- `webpageURL`

In order for this to work your identifiers must be:

- unique
- global (to work across platforms)
- stable (to recognize the same activity over and over)

## Best practices

- Make the titles:
  - Human readable
  - descriptive
  - use direct title

- Identifiers
  - avoid device specific data
  - avoid transient information
  - think long term
  - prefer `targetContentIdentifier` and `persistentIdentifier`
  - use the same identifier for `targetContentIdentifier` and `persistentIdentifier`
  - use `webpageURL` as fallback
