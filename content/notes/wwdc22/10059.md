## Progressive disclosure

- designing APIs so that the complexity of the call site grows with the complexity of the use case
- an ideal API is both simple and approachable but also be able to accommodate powerful use cases

- provide intelligent defaults - so those common cases can specify only what they need to
- optimize the call site - ensuring every character of your call site has a purpose
- compose, don't enumerate
