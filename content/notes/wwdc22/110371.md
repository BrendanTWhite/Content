## Evaluate needs

- before: separate targets with different code bases, few overlapping build settings, heavily customized
- in Xcode 14, a single target can declare multiple supported platforms

## Configure project

- select the new multiplatform app template
- you can setup the different destinations in the `General` tab

- recommended only with SwiftUI or Mac Catalyst projects
- easy to add more destinations, such as Apple TV
- when adding a new destination, Xcode will adjust project to make things build, some issues need to be resolved manually
- when transitioning from Catalyst, Xcode will warn when adding Mac and remind to remove the destination, you can keep until ready
- many app target settings allow conditionalizing them for destination

- No extra steps to take for signing when using automatic signing
- Any applicable capabilities get applied automatically, in a combined single entitlements file

## Resolve build issues

- Framework availability, conditionalizing possible
- Swift allows to conditionalize parts of code where needed
- `#if canImport(ARKit)` could be used, for example, but not always useful
- Instead, you can search for a file in Build Phases and only compile for iOS

- for `unavailable` UI like `editMode` environment, use `#if os(iOS)`

## Customize experience

- Conditionalize constants such as point sizes, macOS typically smaller due to no touch needed

- for macOS only features such a `MenuBarExtra` use `if os(macOS)`

### Platform experience

- Utilize platform features
- Refine choices for new expectations
- Rely on SwiftUI for best practices
- Refer to Human Interface Guidelines

## Publish app

- Archiving still happens per destination, not all in one
- Xcode Cloud could be used to for publishing, too
