## Multiplatform app target

- support many destinations across multiple platforms
- common codebase and settings
- new ways to conditionalize individual settings and files

## Configure project

### Support many destinations across multiple platforms

- recommended especially for SwiftUI or Mac Catalyst projects
- if you're starting from scratch, use the improved <kbd>Multiplatform App</kbd> template 
- it's also possible to upgrade an existing codebase:
  - in Xcode, open your project editor and select the app target
  - in the `General` tab, we can see a list of all the destinations our app support
  - there we can ass as many destinations as we like

### Conditionalize individual settings and files

- Most settings in the target editor now come with a <kbd>Conditions</kbd> option
- <kbd>Conditions</kbd> lets us specify different values based on which SDK is being targeted (macOS, iOS, ..)

- App capabilities that can be shared across different destinations will get combined into a single entitlements file

## Resolve build issues

### Framework availability

Quick way:

```swift
#if canImport(ARKit)
import ARKit
#endif
```

> This is useful if I don't want to manage a list of known platforms a framework is available for and simply say if it's not available, don't include it.

If, instead, we want to entirely exclude a file entirely when targeting a specific SDK:

- open your target editor and go to the <kbd>Build Phases</kbd> tab
- select your file and, in the <kbd>Filters</kbd> column, specify for which SDK(s) this file should be included

### API availability

Use the `#if os(iOS)` compiler macro

```swift
#if os(iOS)
@Environment(\.editMode) private var editMode
#endif
```

It can be used to hide properties, SwiftUI modifiers, etc.

## Platform experience

- Utilize each platform features
- Refine choices for new expectations
- Rely on SwiftUI for best practices
- Refer to [Human Interface Guidelines][hig]

## Publish app

- Just because we have a single target, it doesn't mean we only have a single product
- We'll need to archive for each platform and upload those individually
- If you're building and archiving locally, you'll need to select a destination that has the SDK you want to create an archive for
- Once I have a destination selected, I can choose "Product Archive" to create the archive
- Once my archives are complete, I can use the Organizer window in Xcode to upload them to App Store Connect
