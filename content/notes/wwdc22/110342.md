# When to use charts

To demonstrate how an app can be enhanced with charts, we go back to our food truck selling pancakes app.

Here are some common cases where a chart can be used to highlight the information being presented: 
- When showing historical or predicted values
- By visualizing a portion of a whole
- When comparing items or categories, we can evaluate their values with charts.

## When used correctly, charts provide focus. 

They direct attention to the information we want the user to understand. The goal of the food truck app is to improve the operation of the businesses using it.

Here is some key information useful to the food truck: viewing recent sales, understanding what items are popular, and knowing the best location to visit each day.

# How to use charts

To illustrate recent sales, a chart showing change over time will be appropriate. One way of doing this is to use a bar chart showing sales totals for each of the last 30 days.

## Describe chart contents
A chart should be accompanied by text that describes the chart contents. If read in isolation, it should be informative.
