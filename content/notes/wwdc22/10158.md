## Variable Color

| ![][gif1] | ![][gif2] | ![][gif3] |

- new SF Symbols feature
- allows you to affect the appearance of a symbol using a percentage value
- by changing this value, you can create symbols that reflect values that can change over time
- can be previewed in the SF Symbols.app
- all rendering modes support it
- not all symbols support it
- custom symbols support

Thresholds:

- the various states/layers of each symbol are evenly spaced out between 0 and 100 percent
- 0% is a special case where no layers will be active
- anything above 0% will have at least the first layer active
