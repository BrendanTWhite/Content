# Dive into App Intents

- Introducing AppIntents
    - new framework `App Intents`
    - 3 key components: `Intents`, `Entities`, `App Shortcuts`
    - With App Shortcuts everyone can use with voice from Siri, also appears in Spotlight
    - Intents allow to build focus filters, e.g. Calendar app only shows work calendar when in work mode
    - “Supporting shortcuts multiplies the power of your app”
    - Users can invent entirely new features and capabilities
    - App Intents are concise, modern, easy and maintainable
- Intents and parameters
    - Intent is a single piece of app functionality
        - e.g. “make a new calendar event”, “open a particular screen”
    - Performed manually or automatically
    - Either returns a Result or throws an Error
    - 3 key pieces: Metadata, Parameters, Perform method
    - Sample intent, using `@MainActor` ensures call on main thread

    - Just the above code makes intent available in all these places:

    - Conform to `AppEnum` to provide parameters

    - In intents, `@Parameter(title:)` is used to define parameters
    - Supported types by parameters are:

    - Always provide a parameter summary for every intent you create, supports `when`, `otherwise`, `switch` and `case` APIs
    - use static property `openAppWhenRun` to open app on running
- Entities, queries, and results
    - Entity contains identifier, display of representation and type name
    - Any struct can conform to `AppEntity`, conform to `Identifiable`, `UUID` is a good identifier type
    - `var displayRepresentation: DisplayRepresentation`
    - `static var typeDisplayName: LocalizedStringResource`
    - `StringQuery` and `PropertyQuery to look up entities
    - all queries support suggestions
    - conform to `EntityQuery` on structs for queries
    - hook them up by adding `defaultQuery` to entity
    - conform to `EntityStringQuery` for string search, e.g. books
    - conform error to `CustomLocalizedStringResourceConvertible`
    - provide `ReturnsValue` if you want your shortcut return a result
    - adopt `OpensIntent` protocol in return type to show open button so users can select if app is opened or not
- Properties, finding and filtering
    - Property queries find entities on the properties within entity
    - 3 steps
        - Declare query properties
        - Declar sorting options
        - Implement `entities(matching:)` to run the search
    - Supported query properties example:

    - Conform to `EntityPropertyQuery` with your comparators

- User interactions
    - Dialog
        - spoken or textual response for intent
        - `needsValueDialog` on `@Parameter` for example
        - `Value` (something) result
    - Snippets
        - `ShowsSnippetView` result
    - Request Value
        - ask user for value via `requestValue(String)`
    - Disambiguation
        - let user choose via `requestDisambiguation(among:, dialog:)`
    - Confirmation
        - request confirmation via `requestConfirmation(for:dialog:)` or `requestConfirmation(output: .result(value:dialog:))`
        - Last variant also supports showing a preview
- Architecture and lifecycle
    - In-app
        - No need for a framework / duplicated code
        - No cross-process coordination
        - Higher memory limits
        - Ability to play audio
        - Run in foreground if you set `openAppWhenRun`
        - Implement multi-scene support for best performance
    - Extension
        - Lighter-weight
        - Best performance
        - Focus filter intents run immediately when Focus changes
        - Create by choosing “app intents extension” template in Xcode
    - Your code is the only source of truth
    - Xcode extracts App Intent at build-time
    - Compile AppIntents code directly into app / extension (not through package)
    - Upgrading to App Intents
        - keep using SiriKit intents for Widgets or Siri Domain
        - Others should upgrade
