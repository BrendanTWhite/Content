# What’s new in Xcode

- Xcode is smaller as less platforms by default, starts faster
- Interactive Previews by default (no need to click “Play” button anymore)
- Easy to see multiple dynamic type sizes using the 3rd icon on the bottom left
- First button in bottom left brings back to single view
- Parameters with default value are now italic in auto-completion
- Auto-completion of just the arguments you need via fuzzy search
- You can now see all call-sites of a method via command-click
- Compiler checks Regex literals and shows errors in compile-time

- When Xcode re-diagnoses errors, they dim “gray” → helps differentiate errors from current and previous build
- Current type and function are sticky at the top (for better feeling of where you are)
- Improved parallelism by producing Swift modules
- Linker is up to 2x faster (via increased parallelism)
- Overall, Xcode is 25% faster in building
- Xcode 14 has a new build timeline feature to visualize build times
