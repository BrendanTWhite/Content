## New symbols

- great additions to home, like lights, doors, furniture, power outlets
- health symbols, fitness figures available, more currencies, new objects, more localized symbols (right-to-left etc.)
- 700+ new, bringing to 4,000+ symbols overall
- 5 new categories added:
  - Camera & Photos
  - Accessibility
  - Privacy & Security
  - Home
  - Fitness

## Rendering modes

- Reminder of existing
  - Monochrome (single-color)
  - Hierarchical (subtle emphasis, but single color hue)
  - Palette (allow customized color palette, unique look)
  - Multicolor (intrinsic color of the symbol used)

- New default changes from “monochrome” to “preferred” per symbol
  - called “Automatic Rendering”

- Automatic is a good default, but in some context you should specify explicitly for better contrast (e.g. monochrome for very small sizes)

## Variable Color

- Layers organized in sequential order
- Some symbols have only some portion included in layers
- Highlight sequence of steps or stages, not depth
- Variable color is opacity-based, works together with colors

## Unified annotations

- Easy annotation for custom symbols
- You define a shape setup, e.g. “frosting”, “cup cake base” here

- allows erasing of parts of the shape to customize shapes, like here
