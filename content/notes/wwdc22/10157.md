# What’s new in SF Symbols 4

- New symbols
    - great additions to home, like lights, doors, furnitures, power outlets
    - health symbols, fitness figures available, more currencies, new objects, more localized symbols (right-to-left etc.)
    - 700+ new, bringing to 4,000+ symbols overall
    - 5 new categories added
        - Camera & Photos
        - Accessibility
        - Privacy & Security
        - Home
        - Fitness
- Rendering modes
    - Reminder of existing
        - Monochrome (single-color)
        - Hierarchical (subtle emphasis, but single color hue)
        - Palette (allow customized color palette, unique look)
        - Multicolor (intrinsic color of the symbol used)
    - New default changes from “monochrome” to “preferred” per symbol
        - called “Automatic Rendering”
    - Automatic is a good default, but in some context you should specify explicitly for better contrast (e.g. monochrome for very small sizes)
- Variable Color
    - Layers organized in sequential order
    - Some symbols have only some portion included in layers, e.g. only waves are included in this symbol

    - Sample use case: make all waves white for full volume

    - Highlight sequence of steps or stages, not depth
    - Variable color is opacity-based, works together with colors
- Unified annotations
    - Not sure, but I think this is about custom symbols (as I couldn’t find cupcake in SF Symbols 4)
    - You define a shape setup, e.g. “frosting”, “cup cake base” here

    - allows erasing of parts of the shape to customize shapes, like here (no code shown in session):
