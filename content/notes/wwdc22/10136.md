- Declarative, Compositional, like SwiftUI
- requires `import Charts` to use

## Chart

- `Chart` is the main outside wrapper
- `BarMark` with `x` and `y` positions and `.value` data
- first argument of value is description, second the value

- make data types `Identifiable` to use in `Charts`
- supports `ForEach` for `Identifiable` data collections
- Implicit `forEach` via a `Chart` initializer taking a data collection
- Charts chooses an appropriate visualization automatically
- Adapts to dynamic type, device sizes, orientations, dark mode and supports accessibility automatically

## Features

- When navigation charts in VoiceOver speaks the description + value
- Supports AudioGraph feature from 2021, too (peep sounds)
- .value also accepts a `unit` for types like `Date`, e.g. `.day`
- Supports SwiftUI animations (e.g. animate between different data collections but same bar chart view)
- Use `.foregroundStyle(by:` to group data by color â†’ auto-generated legend for the colors
- Easy to change from `BarMark` to `PointMark` or `LineMark` (great for prototyping charts!)
- Also `.symbol(by:` a value available to use square/circle instead of color to differentiate data form each other
- Marks: Bar, Point, Line
- Mark Properties: X Position, Y Position, Foreground Style, Symbol
