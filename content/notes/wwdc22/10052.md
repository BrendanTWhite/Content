- New SwiftUI app structure!?
- Apple is using SwiftUI more internally now

## Swift Charts

- `Chart` view that takes data, `BarMark`, `LineMark` and other views inside
- `.foregroundStyle(by: ...)` helps declaratively specify details
- `.symbol(by: ...)` to declaratively specify details in chart
- `.annotation` supported, e.g. for marks
- supports dark mode automatically (like any SwiftUI view)
- Smart defaults for legends etc.

## Navigation and windows

### Stacks

- `NavigationStack` a new container view for push/pop style navigation
- wraps a root content view
- works with `NavigationLink` and `.navigationTitle`
- New data-driven APIs: `.navigationDestination(for: ...)`
- `NavigationLink` can now take a value that represents a destination
- now also supported on macOS

### Split Views

- `NavigationSplitView` for multi-column navigation
- can declare 2- or 3-column layouts
- accepts a `detail` view
- Split view adapts on resize automatically
- works with stack together for complex navigation structures

### Scene

- `Window` added for single unique windows of an app (not a group)
- appears automatically in `Windows` menu bar
- `.keyboardShortcut` to open the window easily
- new @Environment action openWindow available to call for navigation
- `.defaultPosition` and `defaultSize` for default positions of windows
- `.presentationDetents` modifier allows resizable sheets, e.g. with two different sizes
- Menu bar extras now entirely in SwiftUI via `MenuBarExtra`
    - always shown in Menu Bar while app is running
    - also possible to just provide a `MenuBarExtra` in an app as root scene

## Advanced controls

### Forms

- new settings app design in macOS uses new navigation SwiftUI views
- New `.formStyle(.grouped)` for forms to improve forms on macOS
- `LabeledContent` used to build new controls or just read-only information
    - allows selection for simple data

- SwiftUI is now smarter in formatting text in Forms
- New popup menu pickers in iOS (macOS inspired dropdowns)

### Controls

- `TextField` can now have an expanding `axis` specified (e.g. `.vertical`
- `.lineLimit(5...10)` range helps expanding with min lines
- `MultiDatePicker` available now, too
- `DisclosureGroup` to combine multiple toggles in one toggle
- `Picker` also mixable with toggles … (didn’t understand)
- New button style
- `Stepper` with `format` parameter, now also available on watchOS
- `.accessibilityQuickAction` with button for easy accessibility

### Tables

- `Table` now supported on iPadOS
- Will render also on iPhone with a primary column
- new `.contextMenu` modifier with multiple selections possible
- allows to define advanced context menus
- new `.toolbar` in iPadOS, customizable by specifying explicit `id`
- placement: `.secondaryAction` to be used for toolbar items
- `.searchable` modifier now accepts `tokens:` for tokenized inputs
- it also supports `scope:` for search scopes (filters)

## Sharing

### Photos Picker

- `PhotosPicker` view anywhere in app, presents picker UI
- takes a binding to a selected `PhotosPickerItem`
- filtering type of content and more customizable

### Sharing

- watchOS supports `ShareLink` view, provide content and preview
- adapt to the `.contextMenu` they’re applied to

### Transferable

- Makes drag & drop easy
- `.dropDestination` with `payloadType`, comes with closure for received data
- many standard types conform to `Transferable`
- Implement in custom types by conforming to `representation: some TransferRepresentation`

## Graphics and layout

### Shape Styles

- new `.gradient` property on color
- new `.shadow` property on color, too
- Combined with SFSymbols, easy to make great custom icons
- soft glow via `.ellipticalGradient` for example
- Text and Image animatoins are taken to “the next level”, just use `withAnimation`

### Layout

- new `Grid` container view that arranges views in 2D grid
- enables automatic alignments across rows and colunns
- `Grid`, `GridRow` and `.gridCellColumns` APIs to specify
- new `Layout` protocol for even more customization
- new `AnyLayout` type to switch between layouts easily
