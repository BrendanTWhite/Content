## TextKit 2

- Performant, modern, less code for cooler stuff
- Forms the foundation of text layout & rendering
- Future performance enhancements & updates all in TextKit 2
- All text controls in UIKit and AppKit are now using TextKit 2

## What’s new in TextKit 2

- Most views shouldn’t require any adoption and should opt-in automatically
- TextEdit app uses TextKit 2 everywhere, even in Rich Text Mode
