- Introduction
    - “Passkeys: Next generation authentication technology”
    - Passwords
        - Difficult to use correctly
        - Security vs convenience tradeoffs
        - Phishable and reusable
    - Currently 2-factor authentication takes several steps
        - add passkey button after being signed in
        - system sheet for creating a passkey
        - device generates a passkey
    - With passkey: just select the user name, Face ID & you’re signed in!
    - Passkeys works on the web, too (TouchID)
    - With FIDO alliance the passkeys work cross-platform
    - When on a friends computer, just scan QR code with the phone, it recognizes that it’s for sign in with passkey
    - Looks simple, but does lots of steps in the background, including proximity check and agreements
    - Sharing passkey possible, e.g. via AirDrop
- Designing for passkeys
    - Passkeys are replacements for passwords
    - Refer to them with the noun “passkey”, pluralizes to “passkeys”
    - Don’t design new interfaces for logins, just remove the password text field, but keep the user name field

- Passkeys and AutoFill
    - Built on WebAuthn standard, use public key cryptopgraphy
    - Require WebAuthn backend adoption
    - Part of ASAuthorization API
    - Supports many different credential types, new flexible UI options
    - Setup associated domains first

    - Make sure to use the `.username` text content type on text field
    - Sign in logic via creating a request and starting the controller

    - System will offer autofill when this logic has been run before the text field is clicked by user
    - Nothing gets filled in text field, instead this callback:

    - make sure to verify sign in on the backend using the signature & data
    - Same code also allows passkey sign in from nearby devices
    - Apple was not showing the password field, only when no passkey (maybe a new best practice?)
    - there’s also a modal request, just call `performRequests` instead, it will present a modal sheet with all available keys
    - On web, annotate your username field with `WebAuthn`

    - JavaScript code to sign in (Safari):

    - Switching to a modal request by removing the `mediation` parameter
    - Apple platforms always require UV when biometrics are available, always use `userVerification: "preferred"`
    - Using passkeys on the web
        - Make AutoFill requests early
        - Modal requests require a user gesture
        - Passkeys replace Safari’s legacy platform authenticator
- Streamlining sign-in
    - Modal request with allow lists:
