## Introduction & Simple Demo

- Often apps need a server component
- Swift allows using the same application
- Server Applications are modeled as Swift Packages
- They have an executable `product`
- Example shown with Vapor
- Use `@main` for the entry point
- To greet users making a request to the user, see this example:

- You can just run the server executable scheme & see output in console
- Sample request in client app to the local server

- Heroku used for deployment in Demo, as easy as `git push heroku main`
- Heroku Swift build-pack is built by the community
- Take-aways
    - Swift is a general purpose language â€“ usable on server
    - Xcode is a powerful development environment
    - Choice of cloud providers

## Food Truck Demo

- Server allows to extract your apps database to a server to share
- Food Truck Sample app available to follow along the demo
- Demo is using `Response.Donuts` as the response type
- Models are put into a `Model` namespace using an `enum`
- Storage
    - Files for static data
    - iCloud for user-centric data
    - Database for transactional data
        - Community developed DB support for:
            - Foundation
            - Redis
            - Cassandra
            - Postgres
            - DynamoDB
            - MongoDB
            - SQLite
- They define `Storage` as an `actor` because they hold onto `donuts` there, which can change from multiple threads
- Use a `Shared` model library to reuse code on both client & server

## Wrap-up

- Swift is a general purpose language
- Code sharing between server and client
- Codable for safe serialization
- URLSession to interact with the server
- Xcode is a powerful development environment
