    - Different focus areas available, new:
        - DocC
        - C++ Interop
        - Swift Website
    - Year round mentorships from now on (see Swift blog)
    - [Swift.org/diversity](http://Swift.org/diversity) has more details
    - Cross-platform support
        - new experimental RPMs available for Amazon Linux 2, CentOS 7
    - Dropped support for external Unicode to make Standard lib smaller (replaced by internal implementation)
    - Now Swift also usable in Secure Enclave (& more embedded environments)
- Swift Packages
    - Trust On First Use: Validation only on first download of package
    - Command Plugins: great way to improve workflow for developers, examples:
        - Generate docs
        - Reformat source code
        - Generate test reports
    - “Glue between Open Source tools & package manager”
    - DocC got Objective-C and C support
    - Add Plugin support like this:

    - Build tool plugins
        - scalable way for packages to define plugins
        - examples:
            - source code generation
            - resource processing
        
        Layout:

    - Module collisions solved with module disambiguation now
        
        <img width="1341" alt="Screen Shot 2022-06-08 at 17 08 12" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6942160/172726545-53ebb08e-850a-474f-ba83-62c86cc46c68.png">

        
- Performance improvements
    - Swift driver can be used as a framework
        - allows things like parallelization
        - performance improvements up to 25%
    - Built-time improvements
        - faster type checking of generics
        - 17s in Swift 5.6 improved to 760ms in Swift 5.7 (!!)
    - Runtime improvements
        - optimized protocol conformance checking
- Concurrency updates
    - last year we had `actor` and `async`/`await`
    - back-deployed to macOS 10.15 and iOS 13
    - app bundles the Swift 5.5 runtime
    - Data Race Avoidance
        - eliminates low-level data races (helps with thread-safety)
        - think of an actor as its own island
        - goal for Swift 6 is thread safety by default (like memory safety we already have)
        - enable “strict concurrency checking” in build settings to try now
    - Distributed Actors
        - `distributed` in front of `actor` or `func`
            
            <img width="954" alt="Screen Shot 2022-06-08 at 17 14 45" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6942160/172726595-10823254-5d47-4fc3-9edf-6f5302a0300f.png">

            
        - difference to normal actor is that methods can `throw` because network is involved
        - Distributed Actor package
            - makes distributed systems easier to write
            - integrated networking solution
            - integrated consensus protocol
        - Async Algorithms package
            - seamless integration with async/await
            - e.g.`zip()`, `merge()`, `debounce()`, `chunked()`
        - Concurrency optimizations implemented in Swift 5.7
        - New concurrency view in Instruments for debugging

- Expressive Swift
    - `if let x = x` becomes `if let x` (optional unwrapping)
    - prevents potential errors due to out-of sync naming
    - No need to manually specify a closures result type (closure type inference)
    - Permitted pointer conversion currently:
        
        <img width="1466" alt="Screen Shot 2022-06-08 at 17 20 46" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6942160/172726634-506fe87f-b44f-4b81-a09a-16181d3db1bc.png">

        
    - Pointer mismatches still possible when passing to C
    - C++ working group works on improving the interoperation
    - Special treatment for enabling conversions easily
        
        <img width="1550" alt="Screen Shot 2022-06-08 at 17 21 58" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6942160/172726653-b5e82b22-62cb-4dee-8ed9-bff0026b776d.png">

        
    - String parsing currently is hard (especially indices)
    - “the problem is not the indices expression, it’s the whole function”
    - Answer: Use Regexes!
    - Literals supported now with compile-time checks
        
        <img width="1052" alt="Screen Shot 2022-06-08 at 17 24 07" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6942160/172726666-1ed72f6c-fd17-437b-b577-8f2fb64b47b2.png">

        
    - For those who find Regexes hard to read, new DSL:
        
        <img width="767" alt="Screen Shot 2022-06-08 at 17 25 12" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6942160/172726676-6ceb7b36-4134-4673-b120-86843c753d18.png">

        
    - Requires `import RegexBuilder`
    - Not a beginner-only feature
        - turn into reusable `RegexComponent`, use from other regexes, even are recursive
        - no special escaping needed
        - support literals inside of the builder
        - types can implement custom parsing logic, like `Date`
    - `Regex` supports useful matching functions
    - Custom engine written in Swift
    - Compatible with UTS #18 unicode standard
    - Available in macOS 13, iOS 16, tvOS 16, watchOS 9
    - Generic code clarity
        
        <img width="1523" alt="Screen Shot 2022-06-08 at 17 28 41" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6942160/172726690-5ae0606b-1505-4fe8-926b-0a772ba86dff.png">

        
        - “something that conforms to” vs “a box whose contents conform to”
        - but were referenced by `ProtocolName`, now `any ProtocolName` needed for the box case
            
            <img width="1537" alt="Screen Shot 2022-06-08 at 17 29 35" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6942160/172726700-cc76652b-d473-4986-92b8-884efd180de1.png">

            
        - easier to explain the difference between methods and understand errors
        - Swift will now “open the box” for us, so less “cannot conform to” errors
        - Swift 5.7 fixes the “only be used as a generic constraint” error
        - you can now specify the types in parameter, without the need to a `where` clause using “primary associated type”
            
            <img width="1620" alt="Screen Shot 2022-06-08 at 17 31 43" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6942160/172726715-5d69992c-da65-46bb-9aec-3cc046aa0c38.png">

            
        - `AnyCollection` is a type-erasing wrapper, serves same purpose of `any`
        - `any` is a built-in language feature that makes type-erasing wrappers no longer needed in many cases
        - suggestion: replace your wrappers with typealiases, e.g. `let AnyCollection = any Collection` to keep backwards-compatibility (easier migration)
        - Improvements to `any` types, but still have important limitations
        - Don’t use `any` all the time, use generics instead, use the top one for better performance (generics)
            
            <img width="1617" alt="Screen Shot 2022-06-08 at 17 34 28" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6942160/172726718-363684e1-5f3b-46bd-9cb9-24a8f724ebc6.png">

            
        - `some ProtocolName` supported in more places, simplifies definition of Generics (simplifies above example, just write `some` instead of `any`)
            
            <img width="1584" alt="Screen Shot 2022-06-08 at 17 35 44" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6942160/172726737-1e52715f-0c5a-4ac7-aed0-bef9b65c9763.png">
