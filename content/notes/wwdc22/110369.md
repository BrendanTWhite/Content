## Web navigation

- new navigation experience
  - see it live in any Apple documentation page, e.g. [here][swiftuidoc]

- Any web page contains two main sections: 
  - To the left is a navigator and filter bar - allows you to navigate through your documentation and find APIs quickly
  - To the right is the content view - optimized to be flexible in multiple screen and navigator sizes

- in the navigator, you can also filter to see articles, tutorials, and even hide deprecated pages by selecting tags
  - tags appear when the filter text field is focused

## Optimize your content discoverability

- If we use Swift-DocC default settings, we will get a DocC website with its automatic organization
- the navigator will be organized by types (e.g., tutorials, articles, protocols, and structures)

To optimize your content

1. define the main high-level themes of what developers can do with your framework
2. organize your pages by importance and specificity
3. make group titles as clear and helpful as possible
