## What is a package plugin?

- Swift script that can be run as part of your build
- A package could have plugins as extra, or be all about plugins
- Package plugins are available only within package
- General plugins can be made available to the outside
- Lets you access development tools on your machine

### Command plugins:

- implement custom actions, such as formatters, linters, prepare distribution
- can ask for permission to modify files in package
- some might just read to report some data

### Build tool plugins:

- extend the dependency graph
- applied to each target that needs them

## Demo

- add a package dependency in project, plugin appears in packages

- Adds 3 buttons to context menu of packages in case of SwiftFormat

- You choose the target and can pass extra arguments
- Xcode asks permission for plugins that modify your files, has a “show code” button

## How do plugins work?

- plugins can create files, read dependencies
- plugins run in a Sandbox
- plugin can send results back to Xcode, such as warnings & errors
- `import PackagePlugin` to implement one

- `CommandPlugin` protocol, watch “Create” video for details

## Command plugins

- implement development-time actions
- Run interactively, not during a build
- Can ask for permission to modify package sources
- Usually depend on other tools to do the actual work
- dependencies on tools plugins can be both binaries or source code
- run `swift package plugin --list` to see which plugins are available
- run `swift package <plugin_name>` to run them in current dir
- run with `swift package --allow-writing-to-package-directory <plugin_name>` to give write access
- append `--verbose` to see more output from plugin

## Build tool plugins

- provide commands for the build system, doesn’t execute directly
- can invoke executable provided as binaries or built from source
- supports build commands and prebuild commands
- output files are stored with other build artifacts, not among package sources
- commands run in a sandbox to prevent changes in package
- Requires conforming to `BuildToolPlugin` protocol, return type is `[Command]`

- Build commands run as part of the build
    - You specify input and output paths
    - They run on missing outputs or inputs changing
- Prebuild commands run before the build starts
    - Runs before build
- Add plugins to targets via `plugins` parameter

## Wrap-up

- Package plugins are a powerful way to automate your development workflow
- Extend build system commands
- Automate development tasks
