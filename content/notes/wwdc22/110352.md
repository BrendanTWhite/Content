- Generics are here to abstract away the details of a specific type

## Model with concrete types

- Start with concrete types, generalize when needed

## Identify common capabilities

- Polymorphism allows one piece of code to have many behaviors depending on how this code is used.
- Forms of Polymorphism:
    - Overloads achieve ad-hoc polymorphism
    - Subtypes achieve subtype polymorphism
    - Generics achieve parametric polymorphism
- Overload works by using classes and `override`
    - requires reference semantics
    - requires a method in base class, easy to forget to override
    - difficult to express different parameter types for funcs
    - when using generic param types, lots of boilerplate
    - Fundamental problem: classes are data types

## Build an interface

- Think about the common capabilities and use a `protocol` instead
- A `protocol` separates ideas from implementation details.
- Use `associatedtype` for using generic param names
- Compiler will infer the `associatedtype` by seeing it used in func

## Write generic code

- Parametric polymorphism via `func feed<A>(_ animal: A)` (the `<A>` part)
- Use protocol conformances in `<A: Animal>` or `where A: Animal`
- The `where` clause can be simplified with Swift 5.7 to just state `some Animal` in the param declaration

- `some` indicates that it’s a specific type you’re expecting to work with
- An abstract type that represents a placeholder is an “opaque type”
- Opaque types can be in two positions, param or result

- The underlying type for a local variable is inferred from the value

- Underlying type must be fixed for the scope of the value, or error

- In Swift 5.7 can use some and different type on each call of func

- For return types, the underlying type is global and must be same
- Use `@ViewBuilder` to allow for different conditional types

- You might need to return the underlying type multiple times
- Opaque types must always be named for generic types
- Use `type(of: object)` to get the type of a generic type

- Learn more in “Design protocol interfaces in Swift” talk
- If you need to store different types of animals, use `any`

- `any` keyword indicates that any arbitrary type of your protocol can be stored
- In memory, `any` is represented as something like a box
    - some values fit into the box, sometimes the box stores a pointer

    - This problem is packages into an “Existential” type
    - Existentials provide type erasure
    - New in Swift 5.7 we can use `any` like this:

    - Compiler can convert instances of `any` to `some`, new in Swift 5.7 (it’s like “unboxing” `any` into `some` concrete type)
    - So instead of using a method that expects an `Animal`, call one that expects a `some Animal` if you have an `any Animal`
    - Differences between `some` and `any`:

    - In general, write `some` by default. Only use `any` if you need different arbitrary types.
