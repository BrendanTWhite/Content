## Intro
I would like to show you how the improvements in Xcode Playgrounds make it easier to prototype new features in your project. 

- Rapid iterations. First of all, they allow you to skip rebuilding and relaunching the project whenever you want to prototype a new feature or simply try out a small change in your code. 
- Exercise rare code paths. They also make it much easier to execute code that otherwise would be quite difficult to reach, like the logic responsible for generating an order summary in a shopping app.  
- Try out new dependencies. It's also a perfect environment for trying out code before introducing new dependencies to your project.

I'd like to show you how Xcode Playgrounds are helping me in my project. I've been working on a small app that's meant to help me with my wildlife photography. At the moment, my app helps me with keeping track of the species that I've already found and photographed. 

I want to introduce a new tab for a checklist view. I already started implementing the view. Each bird has a checkbox, which will allow me to track my progress. However, it would be great to narrow this list down a bit.

```swift
extension ChecklistView {
	
	var birdsToShow: [Bird] {
		// TODO: Narrow down the list of birds to find. 
		let birdProvider = BirdProvider(region: .northAmerica)
		return birdProvider.birds
	}
}
```

To do that, I will have to adjust the birdsToShow computed property in my custom ChecklistView. At the moment, it simply creates my BirdProvider type configured for North America and returns all the bird species found on the whole continent. 

To avoid the frequent rebuilding and relaunching the project and then navigating to the ChecklistView to see my changes, I will try to adjust this code in an Xcode Playground. I will start by adding a new playground to my project.

![Rapid iterations][iterations2]

[iterations2]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10250/iterations2.jpg

This is an iOS app, so I'll stick with the iOS templates. I'll type "playground" in the filter bar and select a blank playground.

To iterate even faster, I'll switch to "Automatically run" in the menu that shows up when I long click the run button on the bottom bar.

![Rapid iterations][iterations3]

[iterations3]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10250/iterations3.jpg

This causes the playground to automatically execute the whole code whenever I stop making changes. 

Notice that the playgrounds added to projects have two settings enabled by default: Build Active Scheme and Import App Types. They will ensure that the active scheme is built before each playground execution and that the app target modules are automatically imported. This makes it much easier to work with the types defined within your project. 

![Rapid iterations][iterations4]

[iterations4]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10250/iterations4.jpg

Let's start by declaring a BirdProvider instance like we saw in the birdsToShow property of my ChecklistView.

The result sidebar to the right of the editor shows me that this declaration has generated a playground result. I can use the inline result toggle to see more details.

The inline result shows the details of this BirdProvider instance along with its two properties: the birds array and the provided region.

![Rapid iterations][iterations5]

[iterations5]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10250/iterations5.jpg

Now in Xcode 15, each row also has a type information label, which shows a short summary of the type, and I can use the tooltips for each row to see more details.

For example, the tooltip tells me that the BirdProvider type comes from my app module and that the region enum was defined within that struct. Let's expand the array row to see more details about the birds.

Notice that when I start to interact with the inline result view, Xcode 15 highlights the source code that produced the result. In this case, the view displays the value assigned to the birdProvider constant. This makes it much easier to understand the displayed values. Let's take a closer look at the array elements.

![Rapid iterations][iterations6]

[iterations6]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10250/iterations6.jpg

We saw the nice summaries for the region and birds array properties, but by default, the rows representing each bird only tell us about the array indexes. 

That's because the custom Bird type has no description defined. We can improve this by making the Bird type conform to CustomStringConvertible protocol. I could add an extension here in a playground or in its Sources directory. Both these options would only affect the Bird type in the playground's scope, and we wouldn't get the nice new descriptions in other places that rely on them, like the debugger. That's why I'll add the extension in the file that defines the Bird type.

```swift
extension Bird: CustomStringConvertible {
	public var description: String {
		return "\ (commonName) (\(scientificName))"
	}
}
```

![Rapid iterations][iterations7]

[iterations7]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10250/iterations7.jpg

With the new description definition, each row should show me the common and scientific name of the bird. Let's go back to the playground and see the new description in action.

In the automatic mode of playground execution, the playground will automatically re-execute when you reopen it. Let's expand the birds array row again to check the descriptions.

![Rapid iterations][iterations8]

[iterations8]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10250/iterations8.jpg

This is much better. Now it's clear what the rows represent without expanding them, but let's take a look at other properties of the Bird type.

I have already found and photographed some of these birds, and you can see that some of them already have the photo property, like this Atlantic puffin.

Once I click on its row, the photo is displayed in the new split view-based user interface, which allows me to see the structure of the object along with the preview.

![Rapid iterations][iterations9]

[iterations9]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10250/iterations9.jpg

By default, there is no such preview for my custom Bird type when I click on its row. It would be great to already see the photo here, as I'm not that familiar with all the species names. 

![Rapid iterations][iterations10]

[iterations10]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10250/iterations10.jpg

To achieve that, I can use the CustomPlaygroundDisplayConvertible protocol. As the name of the protocol suggests, this conformance only affects the playground representation, so this time, I'll add the extension in the playground's Sources directory.

I'll import the app module to access the Bird type and add a simple extension that returns the photo property as the playgroundDescription.

```swift
import Foundation
import SampleBirdingApp

extension Bird: CustomPlaygroundDisplayConvertible {
	public var playgroundDescription: Any {
		return photo as Any
	}
}
```

![Rapid iterations][iterations11]

[iterations11]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10250/iterations11.jpg

Notice that I'm explicitly casting photo to Any in the return statement. Without it, the compiler would warn me that we are losing an important piece of information about the value being an optional. 

This is fine in this case, as Xcode Playgrounds handles optionals by only creating a custom description for objects that don't return nil in the playgroundDescription property. Let's go back to the playground again to check the new descriptions.

In Xcode 15, the playgroundDescription returned by types conforming to CustomPlaygroundDisplayConvertible will be displayed in the split view along the object's structure.

Now, the birds that already have a photo will quickly show it without the need of expanding the row. 

![Rapid iterations][iterations12]

[iterations12]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10250/iterations12.jpg


This will make it much easier to work with large collections of this custom type. But today, I'd like to focus on birds that don't have the photos yet. Let's close this inline result and filter out all the birds that have a photo already.

You can see that those two sidebar annotations look a bit different. That's because there are multiple expressions on the new line. I can click on the new control to see the familiar summaries for each expression.

Hovering over the inline result toggles highlights their source code ranges. This makes it clear that the array is the result assigned to the birdsToFind constant and true is the latest value produced by the closure passed to the filter function.

![Rapid iterations][iterations13]

[iterations13]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10250/iterations13.jpg

The result sidebar tells me that the number of all birds that I'm yet to photograph is still over 1,800, which is quite intimidating. I'd like to make it lower by focusing on a smaller group of birds, for example owls.

The array only has five elements now, which is way more encouraging. I'd like to try out my custom ChecklistView with this small group of birds. To do that, I'll create a ChecklistView instance and add each bird one by one.

Let's open the inline result for the ChecklistView.

As a UIView subclass, it now also shows a few properties along with the snapshot. I can switch to the Value history mode, which now also uses the new split-view-based user interface.

![Rapid iterations][iterations14]

[iterations14]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10250/iterations14.jpg

This allows me to see what the ChecklistView looked like in each loop iteration.

It actually helped me find a problem with my view, which incorrectly says "birds" in the header for just one bird. 

![Rapid iterations][iterations15]

[iterations15]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10250/iterations15.jpg

I should be able to fix this by adjusting the strings defined in the new String Catalog.

The first row seems to be the one that is used in the header of my Checklist View. I'll bring up the context menu and select Vary By Plural.

![Rapid iterations][iterations16]

[iterations16]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10250/iterations16.jpg

Once I do that, the affected rows change their state to "Needs review." I'll adjust the singular form of this string.

![Rapid iterations][iterations16a]

[iterations16a]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10250/iterations16a.jpg

make sure to check: 

[Discover String Catalogs](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10155/)

Let's go back to the playground and see what the checklist looks like now with this change. The headers look correct in each loop iteration. I can close this inline result now.

I think my ChecklistView is ready to use. I'll quickly bring the code that we used to narrow down the list of birds to my project.

I'll copy these three lines to the birdsToShow property in my ChecklistView. I will also add a return statement with the new, much smaller array of birds.
