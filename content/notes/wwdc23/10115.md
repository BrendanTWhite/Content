## Intro

- Getting the details right  
- Designing for interaction  
- Testing your ideas  
- Presenting your work

We will speak from our perspective as designers and share personal insights about how SwiftUI has enhanced our design process.  
We will also provide real examples from our work on the newly redesigned Maps app in watchOS 10. On the Maps Design team, we're huge fans of SwiftUI. It's helped us validate design concepts, provided us with unique capabilities that no other tool offers, and given us a better understanding of how interfaces are constructed and brought to life. 

For this year's watchOS app, we developed all our designs in SwiftUI, right on device. This gave us control over every detail, from spacing and typestyles to animations and interactions. In today's session, we'd like to share how SwiftUI impacted this design work.

Along the way, we'll cover how SwiftUI can be a powerful yet approachable tool for designers, how it helps you think through the details of your concepts, design rich interactions, accurately test your ideas, and effectively present your work to others. 

# SwiftUl as a design tool
While SwiftUI is a powerful framework for building applications, it's also a uniquely powerful tool for designers, enabling us to create interfaces with higher levels of speed and precision. Many people with no programming background, just like myself, find that they are able to learn SwiftUI and design productively in a short period of time. That's because SwiftUI is built on the idea that common things should be easy and complex things should be possible.

In practice, this means you don't need to spend time recreating common UI elements. And at the same time, you won't feel limited when it's time to create something brand-new. Here's another way we like to think about this concept. Some tools are really good at making things easy. They lower the floor. A microwave is a good example. Most everyone can use one, and it's great for lots of simple things. However, if I need to make a fancy dinner, a microwave isn't the right tool.

Other tools are focused on being powerful. They raise the ceiling and enable you to make things that are complex and rich. A good example of this is an industrial espresso machine. While these machines enable you to make incredible drinks, they can be unapproachable, hard to learn, and difficult for doing something simple, like making a basic cup of coffee. 

![common things should be easy and complex things should be possible][commonThings2]

SwiftUI strikes the balance between these two types of tools. It lowers the floor for simple tasks and raises the ceiling for creating new and novel things.

When writing SwiftUI, you use a tool called Xcode. In recent years, Xcode has become even more useful for designers, thanks to the addition of a visual canvas that allows you to view and interact with your designs in real time.

Equally helpful for designers is the declarative way that SwiftUI is written. This language model builds on intuition that many of us already have for how interfaces are put together. When writing SwiftUI, you just declare what you want to create. For common elements like a button, we'll just write Button. And for an image, we'll just write Image.

When it comes to styling these elements, it's just as straightforward. SwiftUI provides you with Modifiers to change the appearance of things just as you would in any other design tool. This could be adding effects like drop shadows or borders, changing format of text though unique fonts, or manipulating the layout of elements by changing properties like aspect ratios or paddings. SwiftUI also provides easy access to system controls, like color pickers, and behaviors, like push transitions.

These are built directly into the framework, giving you native functionality right out of the box. If you're using SwiftUI, it also means you now have access to the unique capabilities of Apple hardware. With a bit of work, you can take advantage of things like haptic feedback, audio feeds, cameras, gestures, and sensors like accelerometers. You can also take advantage of all the work that's gone into the dozens of Apple Frameworks.

That means, you can design with dynamic maps using MapKit, pull in live weather information from WeatherKit, or render objects in augmented reality using RealityKit. All of this can happens across Apple platforms because SwiftUI works with iPhone, as well as iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac. In most cases, you can even share code too and take of advantage of how system elements adapt on their own.

# Getting the details right
Modern interfaces are dynamic. The products that we build contain complex flows and highly interactive elements. As a result, there's so many important decisions that we need to make. SwiftUI helps by quickly surfacing all of those important details that need your attention.

That's because SwiftUI makes it easy to build your designs on device. In doing this, you gain a more complete understanding of what you're making. Separate parts now interact together, and you can begin to evaluate the experience as a whole. This process quickly reveals what's working in your design and what still needs attention or polish. On Maps, we've found this to be tremendously helpful.

For example, how an image should look when it's loading or how a button appears when it's pressed. These are the types of things that make a product feel complete. They're easily hidden in static design tools but are quickly surfaced when working in a dynamic tool like SwiftUI.
