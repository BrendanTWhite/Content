## Prerequisites: What You Need to Know for Starters

- [What's new in SF Symbols 4](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10157) from WWDC2022 explains variable color in SF Symbols, automatic choice of rendering mode and more. 
- Kodeco also offers a fairly recent tutorial, [SF Symbols 3 for iOS: Whatâ€™s New](https://www.kodeco.com/28867639-sf-symbols-3-for-ios-what-s-new), that gets you started working with SF Symbols including the SF Symbols Mac app while building a London Transport-themed sample app.

## What's New? Animation!

A quick look back:

2021: three new rendering modes beyond monochrome:
- hierarchical
- palettes
- multicolor 

2022: variable color
- communicate different strength levels, or
- a sequence over time

By default, symbols animate by **layer**. You can optionally animate a whole symbol.

4:30 Symbols animate conceptually through planes, with the ability to move up (appear bigger), down (appear smaller, like a more distant object) or even disappear entirely.
TODO: add screencap

### Configurable Animation Presets

- **Appear**: used when a symbol appears in the interface
- **Disappear**: used when a symbol is removed from the interface
- **Bounce**: confirm a successful interaction or completed action, reinforce a concept, add playfulness
- **Scale**: confirm an action or highlight importance, provide focus or feedback. Scale is stateful, meaning its effect persists until it is removed.
- **Pulse**: conveys ongoing activity by changing opacity. Works well with a single layer in a symbol.
- **Variable Color**: Cumulative highlights the layers one after another while retaining its previous state. Example: the wi-fi symbol showing an active connection. Iterative highlights the layers in a sequence one at a time. Example: the wi-fi symbol searching for a network.**
- **Replace**: Swap one symbol for another to indicate a change in functionality. You can configure directionality, choosing whether symbols move up or down as one replaces the other.

## Animating Your Own Symbols

- Symbols are vector drawings. 
- Draw paths as completely enclosed paths.
- Use **erase layers** for better animation.

Bring your custom symbol into the SF Symbols app to set Draw and Erase layers. This is also where you can set layer colors for multicolor animations. TODO add screencap

## New Symbols

Additions in the following areas were highlighted:
- Automotive, including EV plugs
- Gaming (controllers)
- Weather (including rainbow)

## Further Resources

See Apple's developer site for a [more professional summary](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/) of SF Symbols 5.

There are two related sessions coming in WWDC2023:

- [Create animated symbols](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc23/10257)
- [Animate symbols in your app](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc23/10258)

You'll want to download the latest (beta at the time of this writing) [SF Symbols app](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/).

You may also want to check out one of the many third-part SF Symbol tools. One fun, new one currently in TestFlight beta is [Symbolsaurus](https://testflight.apple.com/join/37LGuo07), which lists which apps on your device use a particular symbol so you can see it in context.
