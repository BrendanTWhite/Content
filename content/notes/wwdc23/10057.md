# UIKit Trait System

UIKit provides many built-in system traits, such as user interface style, horizontal size class, and preferred content size category. In iOS 17, We can define our own custom traits as well. This unlocks a powerful new way to provide data to the app's view controllers and views. The main way to work with traits in UIKit is using [trait collections](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitraitcollection?language=objc).


## UITraitCollection

A trait collection contains traits and their associated values. The traitCollection property of the [UITraitEnvironment](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitraitenvironment?language=objc) protocol contains traits that describe the state of various elements of the iOS user interface, such as size class, display scale, and layout direction. Together, these traits compose the UIKit trait environment.


There are some new APIs in iOS 17 that make it easier to work with trait collections.

*** Initialize a New Closure ***

``` swift 

// Build a new trait collection instance from scratch
let myTraits = UITraitCollection { mutableTraits in
    mutableTraits.userInterfaceIdiom = .phone
    mutableTraits.horizontalSizeClass = .regular
}

```

From the above code, there is a mutableTraints variable in side the closure which conforms to a new protocol called [UIMutableTraits](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uimutabletraits). When the closure finishes executing, the initializer returns an immutable UITraitCollection instance that contains all of the trait values I set inside the closure. 

There’s also a new modifyingTraits method that allows you to create a new instance by modifying values from the original trait collection inside the closure.

``` swift

// Get a new instance by modifying traits of an existing one
let otherTraits = myTraits.modifyingTraits { mutableTraits in
    mutableTraits.horizontalSizeClass = .compact
    mutableTraits.userInterfaceStyle = .dark
}

```

Each trait definition has an associated value type, which is inferred from the defaultValue. 


### UIMutableTraits

The UIMutableTraits protocol provides read-write access to get and set trait values on an underlying container. UIKit uses this protocol to facilitate working with instances of UITraitCollection, which are immutable and read-only. The UITraitCollection initializer init(mutations:) uses an instance of UIMutableTraits, which enables you to set a batch of trait values in one method call. UITraitOverrides conforms to UIMutableTraits, making it easy to set trait overrides on trait environments such as views and view controllers.


``` swift 

// ThemeTrait conforms to UITraitDefinition, and has a defaultValue type of Theme
extension UIMutableTraits {
    var theme: Theme {
        get { self[ThemeTrait.self] }
        set { self[ThemeTrait.self] = newValue }
    }
}

// Apply an override for the custom theme trait.
view.traitOverrides.theme = .monochrome

```

Trait overrides are the mechanism you use to modify data within the trait hierarchy. In iOS 17, it’s easier than ever to apply trait overrides. There’s a new traitOverrides property on each of the trait environment classes, including window scenes, windows, views, view controllers, and presentation controllers.

> Trait overrides applied to the parent affect the parent’s own trait collection. And then the values from the parent’s trait collection are inherited to the child. Finally, the child's trait overrides are applied to the values it inherited to produce its own trait collection.


``` swift

/// Managing trait overrides

func toggleThemeOverride(_ overrideTheme: MyAppTheme) {
    if view.traitOverrides.contains(MyAppThemeTrait.self) {
        // There's an existing theme override; remove it
        view.traitOverrides.remove(MyAppThemeTrait.self)
    } else {
        // There's no existing theme override; apply one
        view.traitOverrides.myAppTheme = overrideTheme
    }
}

```

**Note:** traitCollectionDidChange is deprecated in iOS 17. When you implement traitCollectionDidChange, the system doesn’t know which traits you actually care about, so it has to call that method every time that any trait changes value. However, most classes only use a handful of traits and don’t care about changes to any others. This is why traitCollectionDidChange doesn’t scale as you add more and more custom traits. 


In Place of traitCollectionDidChange we have new traits registration methods in iOS 17.0 with a closure-method based.

> Call registerForTraitChanges and pass an array of traits to register for as well as the target and action method to call on changes. The target parameter is optional. If you omit it, the target will be the same object that registerForTraitChanges is called on.


``` swift

// Register for horizontal size class changes on self
registerForTraitChanges(
    [UITraitHorizontalSizeClass.self],
    action: #selector(UIView.setNeedsLayout)
)

// Register for changes to multiple traits on another view
let anotherView: MyView
anotherView.registerForTraitChanges(
    [UITraitHorizontalSizeClass.self, ContainedInSettingsTrait.self],
    target: self,
    action: #selector(handleTraitChange(view:previousTraitCollection:))
)

@objc func handleTraitChange(view: MyView, previousTraitCollection: UITraitCollection) {
    // Handle the trait change for this view...
}

```

The first parameter is always the object whose traits are changing. Use this parameter to get the new traitCollection. The second parameter will always be the previous trait collection for that object before the change. In addition to registering for individual traits, you can also register using new semantic sets of system traits.
