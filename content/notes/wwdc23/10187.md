# Intro

- Using the model macro  
- Working with your data  
- Use SwiftData with SwiftUl  

SwiftData is a powerful framework for data modeling and management and enhances your modern Swift app. It uses Swift's new macro system to create a seamless API experience.  It is naturally integrated with SwiftUI and works with other platform features, like CloudKit and Widgets.

## Using the model macro 

### @Model
- Powerful new Swift macro  
- Define your schema with code  
- Add SwiftData functionality to model types  

@Model is a new Swift macro that helps to define your model's schema from your Swift code. SwiftData schemas are normal Swift code, but when needed, you can annotate your properties with additional metadata. Using this schema, SwiftData adds powerful functionality to your model objects. 

Add `import SwiftData` and `@Model` to the model class and the schema is generated.
```swift
// Adding @Model to Trip

import SwiftData

@Model
class Trip {
var name: String 
var destination: String 
var endDate: Date 
var startDate: Date

var bucketList: [BucketListItem]? = []
var livingAccommodation: LivingAccommodation?
}
```

Models in SwiftData are the source of truth for your application's schema and drive the persistence experience. Part of this experience will transform the class' stored properties and turns them into persisted properties. 

### Attributes
SwiftData natively adapts your value type properties to be used as attributes right away. These properties include basic value types, like string, int, and float. They can also include more complex value types, such as structs, enums, and codable types too, including collections.

### Relationships
Relationships are inferred from reference types  
- Other model types  
- Collections of model types  

SwiftData models reference types as relationships. You can create links between your model types with relationships and collections of model types.

###  Additional Metadata

@Model will modify all the stored properties on your type. You can influence how SwiftData builds your schema using metadata on your properties.  
- `@Attribute(.unique)` for uniqueness constraint  
- `@Relationship` for choice of inverses and delete propagation rules  
- `@Transient` to exclude property from model  
You can use @Relationship to control the choice of inverses and specify delete propagation rules. These change the behaviors of links between models. You can tell SwiftData not to include specific properties with the Transient macro. 
Here is our previous Trip example. I'll adjust SwiftData's schema generation by adding metadata to our stored properties.
```swift
// Providing additional metadata

import SwiftData

@Model
class Trip {
    @Attribute(.unique) var name: String 
    var destination: String 
    var endDate: Date 
    var startDate: Date
    
    @Relationship(.cascade) var bucketList: [BucketListItem]? = []
    var livingAccommodation: LivingAccommodation?
}
```

# Working with your data
## Model container

The Model container provides the persistent backend  
- Customized with configurations. You can use the default settings just by specifying your schema.  
- Provides schema migration options  
- Create container by specifying the list of model types to store
- optionally provide `ModelConfiguration` with an url, CloudKit and group container identifiers, and migration options
```swift
let container = try ModelContainer(for: [Trip.self, LivingAccommodation.self], configurations: ModelConfiguration(url: URL("path")))
```
- Or in SwiftUI use the modifier
```swift
.modelContainer(for: [Trip.self, LivingAccommodation.self])`
```

## ModelContext

With your container set up, you're ready to fetch and save data with model contexts. You can also use SwiftUI's view and scene modifiers to set up container and have it automatically established in the view's environment.
```swift
import SwiftData 
import SwiftUI

@main
struct TripsApp: App {
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        } 
        .modelContainer(for:
            [Trip.self, 
            LivingAccommodation.self])
        )
    }
}
```
Model contexts observe all the changes to your models and provide many of the actions to operate on them. They are your interface to tracking updates, fetching data, saving changes, and even undoing those changes.  

- Tracking updates  
- Fetching models  
- Saving changes  
- Undoing changes

In SwiftUI, you'll generally get the modelContext from your view's environment after you create your model container.
```swift
import SwiftData 
import SwiftUI

struct ContextView : View {
    @Environment(\.modelContext) private var context
}

// or outside the view hierarchy, a shared main actor bound context,
let context = container.mainContext

// or instantiate new contexts for a given model container.
let context = ModelContext(container)
```

## Fetching Data
New in iOS 17, predicate works with native Swift types and uses Swift macros for strongly typed construction. It's a fully type checked modern replacement for NSPredicate.   

New Swift native types:  
- Predicate  
- FetchDescriptor  
Improvements to SortDescriptor  

## Predicate
- Fully type checked.  
- `#Predicate` construction instead of text parsing  
- Autocompleted keypaths.

Here are a few examples of building predicates.
```swift
// I can specify all the trips whose destination is New York.
let tripPredicate = #Predicate<Trip> {
    S0.destination == "New York"
}

// I can narrow our query down to just trips about birthdays
let tripPredicate = #Predicate<Trip> {
    S0.destination == "New York" && $0.name.contains("birthday")
}

// and I can specify we're only interested in trips planned for the future, as opposed to any of our past adventures. 

let today = Date()
let tripPredicate = #Predicate<Trip> { 
    $0.destination == "New York" &&
    $0.name.contains("birthday") &&
    $0.startDate > today
}
```

We can use the new FetchDescriptor type and instruct our ModelContext to fetch those trips.
```swift
let descriptor = FetchDescriptor<Trip>(predicate: tripPredicate)

let trips = try context.fetch (descriptor)
```

## SortDescriptor
- Updated to support all Comparable types  
- Swift native keypaths..
Working together with FetchDescriptor, Swift SortDescriptor is getting some updates to support native Swift types and keypaths, and we can use SortDescriptor to specify the order in which we'd like our fetched Trips to be organized.

```swift
let descriptor = FetchDescriptor<Trip>(
    sortBy: SortDescriptor(\Trip.name),
    predicate: tripPredicate
)
let trips = try context.fetch(descriptor)
```

## More FetchDescriptor options
- relationships to prefetch  
- result limits  
- exclude unsaved changes and more  

## Modifying Data
Basic operations
- Inserting  
- Deleting  
- Saving  
- Changing

After creating your model objects like any other Swift classes, you can insert them into the context and begin using SwiftData features, like change tracking and persistence. Deleting persistent objects is as easy as telling the ModelContext to mark them for deletion, and you can save these and other pending changes by asking the ModelContext to save them and commit them to the persistent container.
```swift
var myTrip = Trip(name: "Birthday Trip", destination: "New York")

// Insert a new trip
context.insert(myTrip)

// Delete an existing trip
context.delete(myTrip)

// Manually save changes to the context
try context.save()
```

- The `@Model` macro modifies your stored properties for change tracking and observation  
- Updates automatically by the ModelContext

# Use SwiftData in SwiftUI
- Seamless integration with SwiftUI  
- Easy configuration  
- Automatically fetch data and update views  

## View modifiers
- Configure data store with `.modelContainer` which is propagated throughout SwiftUI environment  
- Fetching in SwiftUI with **`@Query`**  
- No need for `@Published` and SwiftUI automatically updates  

With SwiftUI, you can configure your data store, change your options, enable undo, and toggle autosaving. SwiftUI will propagate your model context in its environment.  
Start using your data is the new @Query property wrapper. You can load and filter anything stored in your database with a single line of code.

```swift
// @Query

import SwiftData
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View  {
    @Query(sort: \.startDate, order: .reverse) var trips: [Trip]
    @Environment(\.modelContext) var modelContext
    
    var body: some View {
       NavigationStack() {
          List {
             ForEach(trips) { trip in 
                 // ...
             }
          }
       }
    }
}
```
## Observing changes
- No need for @Published  
- SwiftUl automatically refreshes  

SwiftData supports the all-new observable feature for your modeled properties. SwiftUI will automatically refresh changes on any of the observed properties. SwiftUI and SwiftData work hand in hand
