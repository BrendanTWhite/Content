### UI Foundations
- App icons
	- App icons are familiar but 3D
	- When looked at, they expand
		- System handles this effect by adding specular highlights and shadows
	- Use multiple layers
		- Up to 3
		- Each layer is a square image
		- 1024×1024
		- Circular mask is automatic
	- Keep graphics centered
	- Avoid layers with reduced opacity
- Materials
	- Apps should be easy to place
	- Apps should be easy to use at any distance
	- Apps should be easy to view in any lighting condition
	- Windows act as a canvas for UI
	- Avoid opaque windows
		- Too many opaque windows makes UI feel heavy and overwhelming
	- No distinct light and dark mode
		- Lighting in the room influences the UI
	- Glass window
		- Sidebars use darker materials
		- Other elements uses lighter materials
		- Inputs that are highlighted might user darker materials
	- Don’t stack lighter materials because it impacts contrast
- Typography
	- Semantic names
	- Point based unit sytem
	- see: [[Principles of spatial design]]
	- Font weight
		- Modified to be slightly heavier on visionOS
			- Body is semibold by default
	- Extra Large Title Styles
		- Editorial
	- Use bolder font weights for legibility
- Vibrancy
	- Updates in real time
	- Works on top of the glass material
	- Use system components when possible
		- Takes advantage of vibrancy by default
	- Three modes
		- `primary`
			- standard
		- `secondary`
			- description
			- footnotes
			- subtitles
		- `tertiary`
- Colors
	- Consider using white text or symbols
	- For color
		- Use it in a full button rather than just text
		- System colors adjust hue/vibrancy based on background
### Layout
- Ergonomics
	- Left and right neck motion is easier than up and down
	- Use wider aspect ratios than taller
	- Center important information in your app
- Sizing
	- Use sizes that are easy to target
	- Tap targets should be at least 60x60 points of tappable space.
		- 44 point buttons should have at least 8 points of space around it
	- Buttons in stacks should have at least 16 points of space around them
	- Mini buttons in section headers may look small but they have at least 60 points of space around them
	- Large and XL buttons require less spacing around them
	- Give interactive elements at least 60 points of space
- Focus feedback
	- Hover effect is automatic
		- Disabled buttons don’t have a hover effect
		- Lists and menus should have 4 points of space for the hover effect
			- Same for a lockup like Music.
				- Define a custom region for a single selectable element.
		- Nested elements should have concentric continuous corners.
			- inner corner radius + padding = outer corner radius
		- Every element is concentric to its nested elements
### From screen to spatial
- Inputs
	- Most interaction happens at a distance
	- Additionally, direct interaction or keyboard / trackpad
	- Use system components
	- see:: [[Design for spatial input]]
- Window
- Tab bar
	- Vertical and fixed on the left side of Windows
	- Avoid having more than 6 items
	- Long looks shows labels for each section
- Side bar
	- Used to provide sub navigation from the tab bar
- Ornaments
	- Positioned outside the window with depth
	- Great for toolbars
	- Usually a collection of buttons
		- Borderless buttons
	- Examples
		- Years/Months/Days in Photos
		- Playback Controls in Music
	- At the bottom
		- Overlap by 20 points
	- Only show ornaments when looking at a single piece of conent
	- Ornaments can expand or have navigation hierarchy
- Menus and Popover
	- Centered
	- Can expand outside the window
	- Buttons should be selected when the menu or popover is open
	- Avoid using buttons with white backgrounds unless selected
- Sheets
	- Centered
	- Maintain z position of the window and the window pushes back
	- Secondary modal cal be used with additional dimming
	- Consider push navigation within modals
	- Close and back buttons should be in the top left
- Outside windows
	- Spatial Captures
