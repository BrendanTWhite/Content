## Web Apps features
- iOS17 and MacOS Sonoma fully support Home Screen web apps.
- Web apps on Mac work great with no adoption required by developers.
- Any website can become a web app. 
- Web apps on Mac are fully integrated with many of the features that you would expect from a native app on macOS.
- Like all Mac apps, web apps work great with Stage Manager, Mission Control, and keyboard shortcuts, such as command + tab.
- Web apps can be opened from the Dock, Launchpad, and Spotlight Search.
- Web apps work with AutoFill credentials from iCloud Keychain and from third-party apps that have adopted the Credential Provider Extension API.
- Add to Home Screen is now available in Safari View Controller.  
- We can create a web app by adding a website to the Dock from the File menu `File > Add to Dock`.


## Customising your Web Apps
When a webpage is added to the Dock on macOS, it is always treated as a web app. Furthermore : 
- We can control the initial behavior of the toolbar for the web app's window.
- We can customize the experience of the user through system permission prompts and in the Privacy & Security section of System Settings .
- The default behavior on iOS is different from macOS. 
- Websites that have been added to the Home Screen on iOS and iPadOS, with the standalone display mode, will become a Home Screen web app.
- Home Screen web apps have a standalone, app-like experience on iOS, with separate cookies and storage from the browser. 
- There's no browser-provided UI, such as a toolbar, and all the content is from the web page.
- If you want your site to be able to use Web Push and badging on iOS, then you should use the standalone display mode.
- To set the display mode add a web app manifest to the site. 
- The web app manifest is a way for a website to communicate its intended behavior for web app-related features with the system.
- To add a web app manifest to your website, simply add a link with `rel="manifest"` ,to a JSON file in the head of your HTML.
- In the corresponding manifest file, add the keys and values that apply to your website.
- Set the name of the web app and change the display mode, set display to `“standalone”`
- On macOS, the web app will not have a toolbar and on iOS and iPadOS, the site will open in a Home Screen web app.

#### Links clicked within the Web App when opened
- All web apps have an associated scope. 
- Links within the scope open within the web app. 
- The default scope is the host of the webpage used to create the web app. 
- Refine the scope using the web app manifest to limit it to a specific path on your site.
- Any links within the scope will stay within the web app and any links outside the scope will open in the default browser. 
- For links in the scope to open in the default browser just adjust the scope in the web app manifest by adding the `"start_url"`. 
- Now add the scope. The scope is a subdirectory of the manifest URL.
- In Home Screen web apps on iOS, links outside the scope will open in Safari View Controller.


## Authentication best practices
- Use cookies for authentication state
- Ensure login flow stays within the web app
- OAuth implementation
- Emailed login links

## Notifications
- Standard based web push.
- Use application icons.
- Notification sound: 
  - iOS and iPadOS sound on by default and macOS sound off by default. 
  - If the notification should be silent, set `silent: true` in the options when requesting your notification. 
  - If the notification should make a sound, then set `silent: false`.
- Just like for native app notifications, users can control notification sounds using notifications settings
- Badging:
  - Useful to alert users that there is something to address in the web app.
  - Badges can be updated when the web app is open and when push events are being handled in the background. 
  - Users can always configure badges in Settings.


## Focus 
- Home Screen web apps on iOS and web apps on Mac integrate with Focus to give users control over their notifications.
- Users can set which notifications they want to see in different Focus modes across all devices. 
- The `"id"` manifest key defines unique web apps within the same domain.
- Used for syncing Focus modes and can be useful if you have multiple parts of your website that should be treated as distinct web apps under the same domain.
- If you only have one web app for a given domain, then you don't need to set the id.
- The fallback if there is no id provided is the `start_url`

### Focus syncing
- Focus modes sync across all of a user's devices.
- Both you and your users control how Focus mode settings are synced.
- Separate id keys of the web app manifest can be used in the wb apps.
- Focus modes sync across a user's device when the name and id align.
- Users can create multiple instances of a web app for a given site on their device.
