## Intro

Getting location updates now is as simple as writing this one line of code. This is our new Swift native API, with out of box support for modern swift concurrency to get location updates:

```swift
for try await update in CLLocationUpdate.liveUpdates() {
    print("My current location : \(update.location)")
}
```
