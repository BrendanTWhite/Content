## Intro
Building software, and especially apps, is a really iterative and creative process, so we want the fastest way to test our code.

# What are previews
A preview is a snippet of code that makes and configures a view. They are written at the top level of a source file, meaning they are not nested inside of any types or functions.

```swift
#Preview {
	MyView()
}
```

# Writing previews
# Previews in your project

1. A name
2. An optional configuration context for the preview to


```swift
#Preview("Name", <configuration‚Ä¶>) {
   Content()
}
```

There are two (2) main kinds of content you can preview

1. Views
2. Widgets

## Views

Views can come from SwiftUI, UIKit, or AppKit.

### SwiftUI

* For SwiftUI, just return any view that you're working on ...
* ... but it doesn't _have_ to be - you can return your view embedded in any other views you need to give the view a broader context (eg. if you are working on a view that always appears in a list, you can return a populated list view)

* The return value is the place to attach modifiers that provide data through the environment, eg.

```swift
#Preview {
   List {
      CollageView(layout: .twoByTwoGrid)
   }
   .environment(CollageLayoutStore.sample)
}
```

* support passing one or more configuration traits as a variadic argument list
* For example, you can set a starting orientation for the device that you‚Äôre previewing on

```swift
#Preview(‚Äú2x2 Grid‚Äù, traits: .landscapeLeft) {
   List {
      CollageView(layout: .twoByTwoGrid)
   }
   .environment(CollageLayoutStore.sample)
}
```

### UIKit/AppKit

* Same idea as for the SwiftUI API
* Create a view controller or a view and return it

```swift
#Preview {
   var controller = SavedCollagesController()
   controller.dataSource = CollagesDataStore.sample
   controller.layoutMode = .grid
   return controller
}
```

```swift
#Preview(‚ÄúFilter View‚Äù) {
    var view = CollageFilterDisplayView()
    view.filter = .bloom(amount: 15.0)
    view.imageData = ‚Ä¶
    return view
}
```

## Three preview modes 

These appear in the bottom left corner of the canvas

![The Xcode controls for setting the preview mode][preview-modes]
[preview-modes]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10252/preview-modes.jpg

### Live (interactive) mode

* Is the default mode
* Can run animations, call out to and respond to asynchronous code

### Static mode

* Takes a snapshot of the view
* Allows interaction within the canvas
* Clicking a view highlights the line of code that made it in the source editor
* Double-clicking certain text views (such as a label) will move the focus to the source editor so I can quickly make changes to that view

### Variants mode

* Variants mode allows you to display a grid of variations of your view
* Can pick which device setting to see all the values for, such as
  * color scheme
  * all of the dynamic type sizes
* Inspect an individual variant by clicking it
* Can then page through all the variants and check that they present correctly


## Widgets

Two kinds of widgets you can preview

* Timeline provider
* Live Activities

### Timeline provider

* Widgets that use a timeline provider which produces individual entries
* Previews snapshots each timeline entry and shows them in the canvas
* Click on an entry to preview in the canvas
* Xcode communicates with the widget to show transitions with animations between each timeline entry

```swift
#Preview(as: .systemSmall) {
   FrameWidget()
} timelineProvider: {
   RandomCollageProvider()
}
```

* To display specific scenarios (rather than the entire timeline), use the `timeline` parameter to return just the timeline entries you're interested in
* Useful if there are (eg) specific transition scenarios which cause issues in your widget

```
#Preview(as: systemSmall) {
   FrameWidget()
} timeline: {
   let first = CollageLayout<Void>
      .preset_2x3_left.map { _ - in Color.gray }
      .fillSlice(at: 0, with: [.green, .orange, .cyan])
   let second = first.fillSlice(at: 1, with: [.blue])
   ImageGridEntry (layout: first)
   ImageGridEntry (layout: second)
}
```

* Clicking the 'play' button under the preview will animate between timeline states
* Pressing the 'pin' button in the upper left of the canvas will allow you to change code files without losing your canvas
* Useful for fine tuning your transitions

### Live Activities

* Basically the same api as for timeline provider widgets
* Need to provide a set of live activity attributes and a set of states

```swift
#Preview(as: .dynamicIsland(.compact), PizzaDeliveryAttributes()) {
   FoodOrderWidget()
} contentStates: {
   PizzaState.preparing
   PizzaState.baking
   PizzaState.outForDelivery
}
```

## Previewing content in library targets

* Including frameworks, Swift packages or dynamic libraries
* Previews works great in these targets
* The first step in leveraging libraries is getting a sense of the **executable** that Previews uses for running your code
* Previews **need an executable, an app or a widget**, to launch and render previews

So if you don't have an app, how does this work?

* Previews uses three things to figure out which executable to use :-
  1. The source files you're working in
  2. The targets containing those files and all the dependencies of those targets 
  3. Previews then intersects those target dependencies with the targets in the scheme that you have selected.
* Previews will only select an app **that's in the active scheme**
* If Preview cannot find an app, it will make one on your behalf (XCPreviewAgent). If you see crash reports for XCPreviewAgent - it's because your code caused them :-)

You can take advantage of library targets to make previews work better.

* Create smaller schemes to focus on one part of your project
* Create small 'preview apps' to focus on one part of your project if the previews require info-plist settings (like photo access permissions)

## Development assets

* Can configure folders in build settings that are removed when the app is submitted to the app store.

## Previewing on a device

* The preview canvas includes a device picker that also includes any connected devices
* Preview will build and preview exclusively for this device (bypassing the simulator)
* All preview modes are available on the device
* Updates in the code automatically preview on the device
