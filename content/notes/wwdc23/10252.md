## Intro
Building software, and especially apps, is a really iterative and creative process, so we want the fastest way to test our code.

# What are previews
A preview is a snippet of code that makes and configures a view. They are written at the top level of a source file, meaning they are not nested inside of any types or functions.  And they can literally be this simple. You use the #Preview macro, and return a view.

```swift
#Preview {
	MyView()
}
```

![What are previews][preview]

Previews are compiled into your app, right alongside the rest of your app code and your resources.

![What are previews][preview2]

[preview2]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10252/preview2.jpg

Because your previews can access these symbols and resources, previews are really flexible.

But previews are also about iterating faster. When you edit any of the Swift code in your project, Xcode will do two things automatically. First, it'll examine the change you made and recompile the minimal amount of code. And then, second, re-run your preview.

This means that you can focus on writing and iterating on your code, and Xcode will automatically handle building, running, and updating your previews. And, once you have a preview defined, Xcode can run that preview in different contexts automatically without you needing to write any additional code. For example, you can test it in dark mode or different type sizes and orientations.

## Previews are like tests
- They execute code in your project  
- Help you develop faster  
- Preview all layers of your app  

This isn’t a perfect analogy, but it might be helpful to think of previews similar to tests. Like tests, previews run real code in your real project. We're not emulating or interpreting code.  
Investing in writing tests and previews, ultimately helps you develop faster. Even a little bit can go a long way. Also, you can test and preview different layers of your app. For example, with tests, you can have high level UI tests that exercise a significant portion of your app’s functionality, and you can have smaller unit tests that test individual components. Similarly, you can have previews for views that encompass a lot of your application, and you can have previews that show individual leaf views.

# Writing previews

Regardless of what you preview, every preview you define has the same basic shape.

```swift
// Anatomy of a preview initializer

#Preview {
	Content()
}
```

First, start with the Preview macro initializer at the top level of a source file. Then, return one or more trailing closures of content. This is where you can configure your UI for exactly the scenario that you want to preview.  
And that’s all that’s required to make a preview, but you also optionally can configure the preview itself for even more flexibility. You can give it a name, and depending on the content of the preview, you might need or want to pass additional configuration in the initializer.
```swift
// Anatomy of a preview initializer
#Preview("Name", configuration) {
	Content()
}
```
We’ll look at some examples of this. Let’s talk about the kind of content you can preview. There are two main kinds: views and widgets. Views can come from SwiftUI, UIKit, or AppKit.

![What are previews][preview4]

[preview4]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10252/preview4.jpg

For SwiftUI, just return any view that you’re working on. But you don’t have to just pass the view you’re working on; You can place it in whatever other views that you need. And this is helpful because oftentimes you want to work on a view in some broader context. For example, a view that’s always really intended to be in a List.
```swift
// SwiftUI
#Preview {
	List {
		CollageView(layout: .twoByTwoGrid)
	}
}
```


This is also the place to attach modifiers that provide data through the environment if the views you’re previewing need it.
```swift
// SwiftUI
#Preview {
	List {
		CollageView(layout: .twoByTwoGrid)
	}
	.environment(CollageLayoutStore.sample)
}
```

Previews are kind of like the scenes that you define at the top level of your app. Scenes serve as the entry points to your app. You set up data and you pass it through your views. Previews serve the same purpose, so you can use the preview to set up data and assets and then pass them into the views you’re previewing. When it comes to configuring the preview, you can give it a name. And view-based previews, like SwiftUI, support passing one or more configuration traits as a variadic argument list.

```swift
#Preview(“2x2 Grid”, traits: .landscapeLeft) {
   List {
      CollageView(layout: .twoByTwoGrid)
   }
   .environment(CollageLayoutStore.sample)
}
```

For example, you can set a starting orientation for the device that you’re previewing on. The shape of the API is the same for UIKit and AppKit. Instead of a SwiftUI view, just make a view controller, and configure it as needed.
```swift
#Preview {
   var controller = SavedCollagesController()
   controller.dataSource = CollagesDataStore.sample
   controller.layoutMode = .grid
   return controller
}
```

Beyond view controllers, you can also preview a UIView or NSView directly. So there’s lots of flexibility depending on what you’re trying to build.
```swift
#Preview(“Filter View”) {
    var view = CollageFilterDisplayView()
    view.filter = .bloom(amount: 15.0)
    view.imageData = …
    return view
}
```

I’m in the middle of writing an app that makes collages of images. I can pick the photos, I can pick the layout, and add filters.

![What are previews][preview5]

[preview5]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10252/preview5.jpg

Let's go to Xcode and explore the features of the Preview canvas. I’ve started writing the view that lets me add a filter to an image. To help me iterate on this view, I’ll need a preview. To start, I’ll make sure the canvas mode is enabled by going to upper right of the editor and clicking the options menu.

![What are previews][preview6]

[preview6]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10252/preview6.jpg

But even with the canvas mode enabled, the canvas stays hidden unless there is a preview defined in the file, so let’s add one.

When I start typing #Preview, Xcode suggests a preview for me. Once I accept the completion, Xcode builds and runs my preview, and my view appears right in the canvas.

![What are previews][preview7]

[preview7]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10252/preview7.jpg

There are three different modes I can use to work on my view. These appear in the bottom left corner of the canvas. The first and default mode is the live or interactive mode. I spend most of my time in this mode because I can interact with my view in the canvas like dragging these sliders. I can also test animations and I can call and respond to asynchronous code.

The second mode is the selection, or static mode.
This mode takes a snapshot of my view and allows me to interact with the elements in the canvas. Clicking a view highlights the line of code that made it in the source editor. And if I double click certain text views, like this Label, it will move the focus to the source editor so I can quickly change it. Vignette is a more succinct label.

![What are previews][preview8]

[preview8]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10252/preview8.jpg

Let’s talk about the environment. That is, the preview environment. The canvas is showing me my preview in light mode, but what if I want to see it in dark mode? I’m going to use the Device Settings popover in the canvas instead. In the bottom bar, click the controls icon to bring up the settings. Now I can enable dark mode or a specific dynamic type size.

![What are previews][preview9]

[preview9]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10252/preview9.jpg

But what if I want to see what my view looks like in both color schemes at the same time? Well, for this, I’ll use the third mode of previews: variants.

![What are previews][preview10]

[preview10]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10252/preview10.jpg

When I click the variants mode in the bottom of the canvas, I can pick which device setting I’d like to see all the values for, like color scheme, or all of the dynamic type sizes. I can inspect an individual variant by clicking it, and then I can page through each of the variants.  
Instead of a VStack, I’m gonna use a Form, which is perfect for groups of controls. And forms look great when the controls are placed in Sections. Let’s make each HStack be a Section. I can make these changes across all of my HStack instances by taking advantage of multi-cursor editing. I’ll select the first HStack, then press Command-Option-E to find and insert a cursor for each instance of HStack. I’ll change each of these to Section.  
I also want a header for each Section, which is provided in a second trailing closure. Arrow down and add the additional trailing closure.  
Let’s use the Labels we already have for these headers. Arrow back up to the Labels and press Command-Option-Right Brace to move the Labels down into the header. And wow, our view looks a lot better.

![What are previews][preview11]

[preview11]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10252/preview11.jpg

These same features all work great with AppKit and UIKit views and view controllers, too.  

I’ll switch tab to the view controller that renders a filter using CoreImage, and switch the canvas back to live mode. Now, I’ve already made a preview for this view controller, and it looks really similar to the SwiftUI one. In the preview macro, I created a view controller and I passed it a sample image.
```swift
#Preview {
	let viewController = FilterRenderingViewController ()
	if let image = UIImage(named: "sample-001")?.cgImage {
		viewController.imageData = image
	}
	return viewController
}
```
But I’d like to test this image with a filter applied, so I’ll add the code to pass a filter to my view controller.
```swift
#Preview {
	let viewController = FilterRenderingViewController ()
	if let image = UIImage(named: "sample-001")?.cgImage {
		viewController.imageData = image
	}
	viewController.filter = Filter (
		bloomAmount: 1.0, 
		vignetteAmount: 1.0, 
		saturationAmount: 0.5
	}
	
	return viewController
}
```

Besides configuring my view controller, I can also configure the preview. Any preview can have an optional name as the first argument. And with view previews, like SwiftUI and UIKit, I can add one or more traits in a variadic list after the name.  
For example, I can set the preview to start in landscape.

# Widgets

There are two kinds of widgets you can preview.

### Timeline provider which produce individual entries.

In Xcode, you can preview either an entire timeline provider, or you can make your own timeline of entries right there in the preview. 

![Widgets][widgets]

[widgets]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10252/widgets.jpg

Let’s go to Xcode to see an example of each of these. My image collage app has a widget with a timeline provider that shows me a randomly built collage every hour. For my timeline provider, I’ll make a preview with three things: First, the widget I want to preview. Second, the timeline provider. And, third, the widget family to use for previewing.

![Widgets][widgets2]

[widgets2]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10252/widgets2.jpg

Even though this widget will build a random collage every hour, I don’t need to wait an hour to see every entry in the timeline. Previews snapshots each timeline entry and shows them in the canvas. I can click through them, or use the arrow keys. And when I do, Xcode communicates with my widget and shows the transitions with animations between these entries, allowing me to spot any issues, not just in the user interface, but the changes between different points of the timeline. Like here, between entries 8 and 9. The animation here is not great. It just cross fades. I want to fix this scenario, but my timeline provider is random, so I don’t know if I’m gonna see this scenario again when I’m testing.  

This is where a timeline of specific entries comes in handy. I can craft the exact scenario I’d like to iterate on. I’ll change timelineProvider: in the Preview to just timeline, and then, instead of returning a timeline provider, I’ll return the two entries that replicate the case I want to fix.

```swift
#Preview(as: systemSmall) {
	FrameWidget()
} timeline: {	
	let first = CollageLayout<Void>
		.preset_2x3_left3.map { _, _ in Color.gray }
		.fillSlice(at: 6, with: [.green, .orange, .cyan])
	let second = first.fillslice(at: 1, with: [.blue])

ImageGridEntry(layout: first)
ImageGridEntry(layout: second)
}
```

![Widgets][widgets3]

[widgets3]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10252/widgets3.jpg

But the code I need to fix for this transition lives in another file, and I don’t want to lose this preview when I navigate away. Conveniently, I can keep the preview in the canvas by using pinning. If I click the pin button in the upper left of the canvas, it'll keep the preview active even when I navigate to another file.

Here’s the view that draws the collage and contains the transition. To help me focus on fixing the issue, in the canvas, I can press the play button in the timeline, and, the loop button. Now Xcode will keep replaying this transition while I fix the code. And, ah, here’s the problem. When the collage is composed of rows, I have a transition attached, but I don’t have one when the collage is composed of columns.  

I can copy and paste the transition. And that’s better, but it’s animating off the trailing edge. I think pushing off the bottom would be better. And there we go.

![Widgets][widgets4]

[widgets4]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10252/widgets4.jpg

With previews, I was able to iterate quickly, not just with my timeline provider, but I was able to fine tune animations using specific events.

### Live Activities

The API looks nearly the same but instead of providing a timeline provider and entries, you provide a set of live activity attributes and a set of states.

![Widgets][widgets5]

[widgets5]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10252/widgets5.jpg

Here’s an example. First, pass in the attributes you want to use in the initializer. Then second, pass in content states for those attributes. For example, if you were building a widget for ordering pizza, you could provide a custom set of states for how the baking and the delivery of that pizza is going, and then test the animations between all of those states. I’m just scratching the surface of what you can do with previewing widgets.

```swift
// Previewing widgets
// Live activities
#Preview(as: .dynamicIsland(.compact), PizzaDeliveryAttributes()) {
   FoodOrderWidget()
} contentStates: {
   PizzaState.preparing
   PizzaState.baking
   PizzaState.outForDelivery
}
```

# Previews in your project
We’re going to survey three different scenarios that affect setting up your project, providing data, and leveraging the capabilities of our devices. First, I want to talk about previewing content in library targets. This includes frameworks, Swift packages, or dynamic libraries.

![Previews in your project][project]

[project]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10252/project.jpg

## Previewing content in library targets
There are many reasons you might be using libraries. For example, you might be using libraries to modularize your project, or you might be developing a library to distribute to others.

![Previews in your project][project2]

[project2]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10252/project2.jpg

Previews works great in these targets, but what’s neat is that you can leverage library targets to take previews further in any project.

### How previews find an executable

- Edited source files
- Target dependencies
- Selected scheme

The first step in leveraging libraries is getting a sense of the executable that Previews uses for running your code. Previews need an executable, an app or a widget, to launch and render previews. Normally this is your app, but if you don’t have an app, how does this work? Previews uses three things to figure out which executable to use. One, the source files that you’re working in. Second, the targets containing those files and all the dependencies of those targets. Then third, previews intersects those target dependencies with the targets in the scheme that you have selected. Previews will only select an app that's in the active scheme.

Let’s look at a few examples. In the simplest case, you might be working in a single source file that’s the member of an application target. It’s probably not a surprise that this is the app we’ll use for previews. But what if you have that source file in two targets? For example, a trial version of your app and the full version of your app. This is where the scheme comes in. Previews will only use the app that is in the active scheme.

![Previews in your project][project3]

[project3]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10252/project3.jpg

Here’s another example: Say you have two Swift files open, each belonging to a package that might also be imported by another package, which are then all imported by an app. We’ll traverse up from those files to find the first common executable at the top.

![Previews in your project][project4]

[project4]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10252/project4.jpg


With that in mind, now we can return to the question we started with: what if I don’t have an app at all? In this case, previews makes an app on your behalf, called the XCPreviewAgent, which will load your library. This all happens automatically for you, but it’s helpful to know how this works and especially the name of this process so that you can know where your code is running. 
So if you don't have an app, how does this work?

![Previews in your project][project5]

[project5]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10252/project5.jpg

## Previewing in libraries
### How to use libraries to your advantage

- Modularize your code into libraries and create smaller schemes  
- Create preview-only apps to specify needed entitlements  

For example, if there's a crash report for XCPreviewAgent, you can know it’s happening in your code and find where the problem is. But, you can take advantage of library targets to make previews work better in your project in at least two ways.  
First, if you modularize your app into libraries, you can create smaller schemes to get better build times or just to be able to focus on one part of your project. And even though you are using a smaller scheme with a subset of your targets, you can still get the full power of previews.  
Second, if you then modularize code into libraries, there might be views that need required entitlements or Info.plist keys that your app target was providing. You can still preview these views by creating a small app just for previewing.  

Here’s how.

Let’s say I’m making a view that uses the Photo library, which requires a specific Info.plist key, and I’ve put that view in a library-- for example, SamplePhotoLibraryUtilities.

![Previews in your project][project6]

[project6]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10252/project6.jpg

I can preview with the right capabilities by making a new app target.

![Previews in your project][project7]

[project7]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10252/project7.jpg

Then, I’ll add whatever capabilities I need. In this case, I need to add an Info.plist key, so I’ll go to the build settings, filter for the Photo library usage string,

![Previews in your project][project8]

[project8]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10252/project8.jpg

and set it.

![Previews in your project][project9]

[project9]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10252/project9.jpg

Next, I’ll make sure my library with the view I’m working on is embedded into my app. Using the build phases tab,

![Previews in your project][project10]

[project10]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10252/project10.jpg


I’ll add it as a target dependency,

![Previews in your project][project11]

[project11]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10252/project11.jpg

and embed it with a copy files phase.

![Previews in your project][project12]

[project12]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10252/project12.jpg

Now I’m ready to select the scheme that contains just this preview app and my library. 

![Previews in your project][project13]

[project13]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10252/project13.jpg

When I preview my view, it'll use the app I just made for previewing, and all of the right Info.plist keys will be in place.

![Previews in your project][project14]

[project14]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10252/project14.jpg

This lets me take advantage of smaller schemes with faster build times while keeping the ability to preview all of the views I’m working on. 

## Development assets

* Can configure folders in build settings that are removed when the app is submitted to the app store.

## Previewing on a device

* The preview canvas includes a device picker that also includes any connected devices
* Preview will build and preview exclusively for this device (bypassing the simulator)
* All preview modes are available on the device
* Updates in the code automatically preview on the device
