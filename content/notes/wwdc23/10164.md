# What‚Äôs new in Swift

# Description

Explore cutting edge language features and new APIs of Swift programming language. 

- Swift project update
- Expressive code
- Swift everywhere

## Swift project update

Core team is creating an ecosystem steering group parallel to the language steering group to oversee progress in tooling, robust support for multiple platforms and rich documentation.

## If/else and switch statements can now be used as expressions

```swift
// Before ü§Ø
let bullet = 
	isRoot && (count == 0 || !willExpand) ? "" 
		: count == 0 ? "- " 
		: maxDepth <= 0 ? "‚ñπ " : "‚ñø "

// After ü§©
let bullet = 
	if isRoot && (count == 0 || !willExpand) { "" }
	else if count == 0 { "- " }
	else if maxDepth <= 0 { "‚ñπ " }
	else { "‚ñø " }
```

## Result builders enhancement

- Result builders have seen significant improvements including optimized type checking performance, code completion and improved error messages.

## Generic improvement

- enabling generic abstraction over argument length <each Result> know as **type parameter pack** (multiple individual type parameters  that are ‚Äúpacked‚Äù together)

```swift
// Before ü§Ø
struct Request<Result> { ... }

struct RequestEvaluator {
	func evaluate<Result>(_:) -> (Result)
	func evaluate<R1, R2>(_:) -> (R1, R2)
	func evaluate<R1, R2, R3>(_:) -> (R1, R2, R3)
	func evaluate<R1, R2, R3, R4>(_:) -> (R1, R2, R3, R4)
}

// Call side
let results = RequestEvaluator.evaluate(r1, r2, r3, r4)

// After ü§©
struct RequestEvaluator {
	func evaluate<each Result>(_: repeat Request<each Result>) -> (repeat each Result)
}

// Call side
let results = RequestEvaluator.evaluate(r1, r2, r3, r4)
```

- The evaluate func now handles all arg lengths with no artificial limit
- Type inference makes APIs using parameter packs natural to use, without needing to know that the API is using them, i.e call-side might not even aware you are using type parameter pack under the hood.

## Swift Macros

- you can extend the capabilities of the lang itself, eliminate boilerplate

```swift
// Normal assert func, not much info will be printed
assert(max(a, b) == c)

// With "hash-assert" syntax is expanding the macro called "assert"
#assert(max(a, b) == c)
```

- assert macro looks and feels like the function version, but, as it‚Äôs a macro, it can provide a richer experience.

- macros are APIs, just like types or functions, you access them by importing the module that defines them
- macros operate on well-typed inputs and produce code that augments your program (hence shipped with compile time type checking and helpful error message
    ![][4]
    
    [4]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10164/IMG_11503A2A17D7-1.jpeg    
    
- Most macros are defined as ‚Äúexternal macros‚Äù, so, you need to specify module and type for actual macro implementation via strings.
- The external macro types are defined in separate programs, that act as compiler plugins. Swift compiler passes the source code (`#assert(a == b)` in our case) for the use of the macro to the plugin, and the plugin produces new source code (the implementation), and that code is then integrated back into the Swift program.
- Macro declarations have one additional piece of info, their role.

- `assert` is labelled as freestanding because it uses the ‚Äúhash‚Äù syntax. It is an expression macro as it can be used anywhere that one can produce a value. If you wanna see example of an expression macro, check out the new Foundation Predicate APIs.

- Swift foundation framework has significant performance improvement
    - Calendar calculations: 20% faster
    - Date formatting: 150% faster
    - JSON coding: 200-500% faster
- `~Copyable` (can be applied to struct and enum declarations) suppresses the implicit ability to copy a type. Once the type is non-copyable, you can give it a deinit (which will run when a value of the type goes out of scope), like you can a class.
    
    ```swift
    struct FileDescriptor: ~Copyable {
    
    	deinit {
    	}
    }
    ```
    
- Calling a `consuming` method or argument gives up ownership of a value to the method you called. Since our type is non-copyable, giving up ownership means you can no longer use the value.
    
    ```swift
    struct FileDescriptor: ~Copyable {
    	private var fd: CInt
    
    	init(descriptor: CInt) { self.fd = descriptor }
    
    	func write(buffer: [UInt8]) throws {
    		// ...
    	}
    	
    	consuming func close() {
    		Darwin.close(fd)
    	}
    
    	deinit {
    		Darwin.close(fd)
    	}
    }
    ```

## C++ Interoperability

- In old days, the interoperability between Swift and C++ goes like this; Swift ‚Üî Objective-C ‚Üî C++
- Swift 5.9 introduces the ability to interact with C++ types and funcs directly from Swift.

    Calling Swift from C++

- Expose most Swift APIs directly to C++ and many C++ idioms can be directly expressed in Swift, often automatically, but occasionally requiring some annotations to indicate the desired semantics
- Can integrate Swift code into CMake build by declaring Swift as one of the languages for the project and putting Swift files into a target.
    
    ```swift
    // CMake
    
    project(PingPong LANGUAGES CXX Swift)
    
    add_library(PingPong
    	Ping.swift
    	Pong.swift
    	TableTennisUtils.cpp
    )
    ```
    
- Can mix C++ and Swift within a single target, and CMake will be compiled separately and link all of the appropriate supporting libraries and runtimes for both.

## Concurrency updates
![][17]

- Actors can be implemented in different ways
- Custom actor executors allows a particular actor to implement its own synchronization mechanism
    
    ![][18]
    
    [18]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10164/IMG_FD8106603DBC-1.jpeg  
    
- Synchronization of actors via dispatch queues is made possible because dispatch queue conforms to the new `SerialExecutor` protocol.
- Can provide own synchronization mechanism to use with actors by defining a new type that conforms to `SerialExecutor` protocol.
