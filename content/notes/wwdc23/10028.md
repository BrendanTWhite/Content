## Key takeaways

#### Changes between entries can now be animated.
#### Widgets can now be interactive.

<br></br>

## Animations
- Changes between entries default to an implicit spring animation and various implicit content transitions
- Animations can be customized with the same APIs you use to customize SwiftUI views; `.animation`, `.transition` and `.contentTransition`.
- The new #Preview macro can be used to quickly preview animations between entries.
```
#Preview(as: WidgetFamily.systemSmall) {
    CaffeineTrackerWidget()
} timeline: {
    CaffeineLogEntry.log1
    CaffeineLogEntry.log2
    CaffeineLogEntry.log3
    CaffeineLogEntry.log4
}
```

## Interactivity
- Actions are exposed to your widget using AppIntents
- AppIntents are passed through new initializers on `Button` and `Toggle`. These are the two only controls that work with widgets so far.
```
extension Button {
    public init<I: AppIntent>(
        intent: I,
        @ViewBuilder label: () -> Label
    )
}

extension Toggle {
    public init<I: AppIntent>(
        isOn: Bool,
        intent: I,
        @ViewBuilder label: () -> Label
    )
}
```
- The return of an AppIntents perform() method will trigger a reload of the widgets UI, so make sure to make any changes to the state before that.
- Use the `@Parameter` property wrapper to pass properties to your AppIntent.
- You can choose the widget extension as the build target, then Xcode will install the widget for you.
- Use the `.invalidatableContent` modifier to indicate a view will update before the new value has arrived, to reduce the feeling of latency.
