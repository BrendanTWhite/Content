Since their introduction, SF Symbols have been a huge part of what makes Apple platforms look and feel the way they do.

![SF Symbols][symbols2]

Symbols are consistent; there are thousands of symbols built into Apple's platforms, sharing common visual designs and behaviors. They can make apps and interfaces feel instantly familiar. Symbols are customizable; if there isn't a built-in symbol that suits your needs, you can use the SF Symbols app to create your own symbols with all the same powerful features as system-provided ones.

And of course, symbols are expressive. Symbols can communicate complex concepts in a small amount of screen real estate. They can convey ideas in a way that transcends languages. And they can make your app feel more alive and playful.

And now, with SF Symbols 5, symbols are gaining a whole new dimension of expressiveness with animation. And the SF Symbols app is here to help you explore this new dimension.

# Previewing animations


So let's get started by firing up the SF Symbols app and taking a look at some examples.

![Previewing animations][animations1]  

[animations1]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10257/animations1.jpg

Our first stop on the tour is a new tab here in the sidebar. This is the animation inspector, and, as you might have guessed, you can use it to preview the new animation effects. Let's switch to the Gallery view to get a better look. And we'll grab one of the built-in speaker symbols to experiment with.

![Previewing animations][animations2]  

[animations2]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10257/animations2.jpg

You can select any of the new animation effects from this pop up button. The Bounce animation is a great place to start. If you hit the preview button, you can see that the animation plays in the main Gallery view, as well as in the symbol row below it and the preview area in the sidebar, so you can see it in all the different rendering modes. Around the preview button, you'll see controls for configuring our animation. You can choose options like whether the symbol should bounce upwards or downwards, and whether you want the layers of the symbol to bounce separately or if you want the whole symbol to bounce at once.

When I changed some of these settings, the label under the preview area changed from “Automatic” to "Modified." When you're writing code for an app, every animation type comes with default settings. When you launch the SF Symbols app, those default settings are pre-selected for you, and you'll see the word "Automatic" here. When you switch to something other than the default, you'll see the word "Modified" here to let you know that you've changed the settings. You can click the reset button that appears here to get back to the defaults.

Once you've found a configuration you like, if you want to specify it directly in code, you can click this button to copy the name of the effect we'll need for the Swift or Objective-C APIs.

But let's get back to checking out the new animations. This speaker symbol also supports variable color. So let's try out the variable color animation.

With the Cumulative option selected, the variable color layers activate gradually, then all fade out together. When we pick Iterative, only one layer activates at a time. And we can turn on the Reversing option to see how this configuration creates a different feeling.

So that's a quick look at the new animation effects. We've been using a system-provided SF Symbol to preview them, but as always, the built-in symbols are only half of the story. 

# Animating custom symbols

If you have custom symbols in your apps, the SF Symbols app can help make sure they're ready to share the animation limelight. Now, I've got some custom symbols from last year when I was working on an app to help me practice solving puzzle cubes with my daughter. This year, I've graduated to speedcubing, so I want to update my app to help me keep track of how long it takes me to solve a cube. Let's grab last year's custom symbols and start getting them ready for animation.

Here's the 3x3 cube symbol we made last year. We annotated it for Hierarchical and Multicolor rendering, and we broke the front face into different layers so we could apply variable color. Because my symbol has variable color, it supports the variable color animation right out of the box.

I could use this for a loading indicator.

![Previewing animations][animations4]

Let's look at some other animations.

Pulse would be great for when my solve timer is paused. But when I hit the Preview button, the whole symbol is pulsing, even though I have the By Layer setting selected. There's a new control in the annotation list here that allows you to specify which layers should pulse when you're using the By Layer setting. If none of the layers in my symbol are marked, the whole symbol will pulse. So let's mark all of the layers that make up the front face to pulse, and preview again. That's the behavior we want. This will look great when my timer is paused.

![Previewing animations][animations5]  

[animations5]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10257/animations5.jpg

All of the other animations use motion, so that should be the next thing we check. If you have symbols that were exported from version 4 or earlier of the SF Symbols app, or if they're exported to be compatible with Xcode 14, they won't include motion information, and they will always move as a whole symbol in your apps. But let's see what happens when I'm exporting from this version of the SF Symbols app, version 5, for use in Xcode 15.

I'll go back to the Bounce animation and play it with my puzzle cube symbol.

That's a lot of motion! By default, every layer in a symbol will move independently when By Layer is selected. Now, I'm pretty excited about symbol animations, but this might be too much of a good thing. We can fix this with a new feature in annotation. You can now create groups of layers that can animate all of their sublayers together. I'll select all of the layers that make up the front face and add them to a new layer group.

Inside of a layer group, all of the layers still keep their own annotations and settings, but now they all move together.

Now there's less motion, but it still looks a little strange to have the different pieces of the cube moving separately.

So let's undo and select all of the layers of our symbol and add them all to a single group.

That matches the spirit of this symbol. The different faces of a cube don't really move separately, and they aren't really at different levels of depth in this drawing. By grouping all of these layers together, we've made sure that the cube will always animate as a single unit, even if the code requests by layer. Ultimately, you'll need to look at your custom symbols individually and decide what motion groups are right for each one.

Now, I mentioned earlier that one of the strengths of symbols is a sense of consistency and familiarity. This is an important concept to remember as you're working with your custom symbols. 

Here's another custom symbol I was working on last year. It's my puzzle cube, but it's been placed on top of a filled circle. This circular enclosure is a common design element in SF Symbols. 

![Previewing animations][animations6]  

[animations6]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10257/animations6.jpg

There are lots of symbols in the built-in library that use a similar circular treatment, like this video symbol. And there are many other examples of this kind of reusable design pattern throughout the SF Symbols repertoire, like circular borders, or modifiers like slashes, or badges. The consistency of these treatments is one of the key things that makes SF Symbols instantly recognizable and familiar. 

![Previewing animations][animations7]  

[animations7]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10257/animations7.jpg

Custom symbols should try to match these treatments to get all the benefits of that familiarity, too. So how can I make sure my custom symbols are consistent with the system? Well, I could look through the library of system symbols to find an example of a similar symbol and base a new drawing off of it. And I could look at how the symbol is annotated in each of the different rendering modes, and how it moves when animated by layer, and how it pulses, and how its variable color settings might change in this enclosure.

And then I could do the same thing for other common design patterns like other enclosures, or slashes, or badges. But that's a lot to remember. And I would rather use that mental space for remembering the fastest way to solve the top layer of my puzzle cubes. 

# Symbol components

One of our goals with SF Symbols has always been to help make it as easy as possible for custom symbols to fit right in alongside system-provided symbols to provide that consistent, familiar experience. 

A symbol component provides artwork and behavior that looks and feels like a system-provided SF Symbol. Take one of your custom symbols, combine it with a symbol component, and you'll get a new symbol that, out-of-the-box, looks and feels like its built-in friends. Let's combine a few components with my trusty puzzle cube symbol to see how they work. I'll start by bringing up the context menu for my custom symbol and choosing Combine Symbol with Component. 

![Previewing animations][animations8]  

[animations8]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10257/animations8.jpg

In the sheet that shows up, I can look through the library of components and choose which ones I want to use. There are enclosures, badges, and a slash component. We'll start with slash, badge.plus, circle, and circle.fill.
