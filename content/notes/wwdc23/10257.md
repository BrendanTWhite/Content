Since their introduction, SF Symbols have been a huge part of what makes Apple platforms look and feel the way they do.

Symbols are consistent; there are thousands of symbols built into Apple's platforms, sharing common visual designs and behaviors. They can make apps and interfaces feel instantly familiar. Symbols are customizable; if there isn't a built-in symbol that suits your needs, you can use the SF Symbols app to create your own symbols with all the same powerful features as system-provided ones.

And of course, symbols are expressive. Symbols can communicate complex concepts in a small amount of screen real estate. They can convey ideas in a way that transcends languages. And they can make your app feel more alive and playful.

And now, with SF Symbols 5, symbols are gaining a whole new dimension of expressiveness with animation. And the SF Symbols app is here to help you explore this new dimension.

# Previewing animations


So let's get started by firing up the SF Symbols app and taking a look at some examples.

Our first stop on the tour is a new tab here in the sidebar. This is the animation inspector, and, as you might have guessed, you can use it to preview the new animation effects. Let's switch to the Gallery view to get a better look. And we'll grab one of the built-in speaker symbols to experiment with.
