## Inspector

- It's a new element in SwiftUI
- Inspector is a view that shows details of selected content
- Inspector is available to SwiftUI Developers on macOS and iPadOS and iOS
- Users are familiar with inspectors as they are already present in many apps, for example Keynote or Shortcuts.
- .inspector is an addition to other SwiftUI Structural APIs like: NavigationSplitView, NavigationStack, .sheet, .popover, .alert, .confirmationDialog 

## Functionalities

The inspector API includes programmatic control over:
- column width
- presented state (allowing hiding and showing of the inspector as needed)

In compact size classes, inspector adapts to a resizable sheet and inspector will automatically overlay in split screen on larger iPads.

## How to

To add inspector to a SwiftUI view, we use .inspector modifier.
Example:
```
.inspector(isPresented: $presented) {
  InspectorForm(item: $state.binding())
}
```

Inspectors can collapse by default, but they aren't resizable by default. We can change it with .inspectorColumnWidth. We can also add a toolbar button to toggle the "presented" property.
Example:
```
.inspector(isPresented: $presented) {
  InspectorForm(item: $state.binding())
    .inspectorColumnWidth(min: 200, ideal: 300, max: 400)
    .toolbar {
      Spacer()
      Button{
        presented.toggle()
      } label: {
        Label("Toggle Inspector", systemImage: "info.circle")
      }
    }
}
```
