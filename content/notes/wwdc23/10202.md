# Materials in visionOS

![What Are Materials][whatAreMaterials]

[whatAreMaterials]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10202/whatAreMaterials.jpg

Materials are what define the appearance of your object in 3D scenes. Materials can be simple, just a single color, or they can use images.You might apply a wood texture to the model of a chair or map an image of bricks to a wall. Materials can also be quite sophisticated. They might use animation to look like rippling water or change appearance based on viewing angle. Think of the iridescent sparkle of mother of pearl. Materials can even modify the geometry of the objects they are applied to. _

## Physically Based Rendering
Materials in visionOS use Physically Based Rendering (PBR) to represent physical properties of real world objects, for example, how metallic or how rough an object looks.  
Let's look at some examples of physically based materials in action.


![Physically Based Rendering example][pbr]

[pbr]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10202/pbr.jpg

Materials consist of one or more **shaders**. These are programs that do the actual work of computing the appearance of their material.

[shaders]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10202/shaders.jpg
With RealityKit 2 for iOS and iPadOS, we introduced CustomMaterial. Shaders in CustomMaterial are hand coded in Metal.

[metal]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10202/metal.jpg

**Surface shaders** operate on the PBR attributes of models. **Geometry modifiers** operate on the geometry of your objects.

## ShaderGraphMaterial

In xrOS, a new type of material is introduced: **ShaderGraphMaterial**.

![shaderGraphMaterial][shaderGraphMaterial]

[shaderGraphMaterial]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10202/shaderGraphMaterial.jpg

**This is the exclusive way of creating custom materials for visionOS**.Based on the open standard [MaterialX](https://materialx.org).

Supports 2 main types of shaders: **Physically Based** and **Custom**.

![shaderGraphMaterial][shaderGraphMaterial2]

[shaderGraphMaterial2]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10202/shaderGraphMaterial2.jpg

- _Physically based shader is intended for simpler use cases (e.g. constant, non-changing values)_
- _Custom is intended for precise and custom control over 3D objects (e.g. animation, geometry modifiers, special effects, etc._)

ShaderGraphMaterial supports two main types of shaders, which we call Physically Based and Custom. Physically Based is a basic PBR shader. Choose this for simpler use cases. You configure this shader by providing constant, nonchanging values, like colors or images, for each property. Custom shaders, on the other hand, give you precise and custom control over the appearance of your 3D objects.  
Custom shaders can incorporate animation, adjust your object's geometry, and create special effects on the surface of your object, like a sparkly paint look.  
You can build ShaderGraphMaterials using the Shader Graph editor right inside Reality Composer Pro. Take a look at the Shader Graph nodes below that instantaneously define the look of the terrain in the viewport.

# Material editing
Materials in xrOS can be created using Reality Composer Pro
![Reality Composer Pro][realityComposerPro]

[realityComposerPro]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10202/realityComposerPro.jpg

If you'd like an introduction to the app before starting with materials, please watch:
[Meet Reality Composer Pro](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10083)

We'll use the Yosemite Valley model that was shown in that session and apply a topographical map appearance to it. I'll explain the math behind our material, then we'll go into Reality Composer Pro's shader editor and build it.  
To save on time, I hid all the objects we don't need for this session using the Deactivate command.

![the Yosemite Valley model in Reality Composer Pro][yosemiteModel]

[yosemiteModel]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10202/yosemiteModel.jpg

## Topography map
Let's add a topography feature. We'll add a material showing the topography of our model by displaying contour lines along the slope of the terrain. It'll look similar to the topographical map that you might have come across when planning a hike. 

![the Yosemite Valley model finished version in Reality Composer Pro][yosemiteModelTopographic]

[yosemiteModelTopographic]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10202/yosemiteModelTopographic.jpg

Let's create a custom material containing a shader that will draw contour lines on our terrain. We want to draw lines on our terrain through all the areas that have the same elevation, like in this diagram. This blue line, for example, shows all points on the terrain at 1000 meters of elevation. Seen from above, it will look something like the diagram on the right.

**Quick Tips**
- add a material by clicking the `+` icon inside the Project Browser
- double-click on the back of the node editor to add nodes
- drag from an empty node output to create a new node connection rather than double-clicking then connecting

This section jumps right into a walk-through tutorial on applying topography lines to a geographical diorama. Starts at [4:31](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10202?time=271)

- New custom shaders start with two nodes, the **surface node** in purple and the **outputs node** in blue. The inputs on the **surface** are how you set your shader's PBR parameters.
- `separate3` node allows you to extract the XYZ coordinate positions.
- `modulo` node gives the remainder of dividing 2 values.

**Important!** make sure you assign your new material to your model in the hierarchy. You do this by selecting your custom material from the model's Material Binding dropdown in the inspector [5:48](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10202?time=349).

# Node graphs 
> _Node graphs help simplify complex materials and let you create your own nodes to reuse parts of graphs._

**Quick Tips**
- Multi-select any set of nodes and right-click > Compose Node Graph to make reusable node components [11:21](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10202?time=681).
- In the project hierarchy, right-click > Create Instance to create an instance of your node graph [11:35](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10202?time=695).
- Add inputs and outputs to your node graph in the inspector [12:10](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10202?time=730).

**Instances** of node graphs are live copies that **adopt any changes made to the original node graph**. They inherit inputs and outputs added to the original node graph it points to.

# Geometry modifiers 
> _A feature of custom materials you can use to modify your models in real time._

**Reminder** _Surface shaders operate on the PBR attributes while Geometry modifiers operate on the geometry of objects._

This section jumps right into a walk-through tutorial on applying heightmaps to generate geometry, and animating between those heightmaps. Starts at [13:46](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10202?time=826).

![Visualization of a geometry modifier constructed with heightmap data.][heightmap]

[heightmap]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10202/heightmap.png

In order to build a geometry modifier, you need to add a `Geometry Modifier Input` node, and connect it to the output node [15:23](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10202?time=923).

Geometry modifiers can move the vertices of geometry in any direction. To specify a direction to move vertices, use the `Combine3` node to create a 3D vector and set it to the XYZ axis you want to manipulate [16:15](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10202?time=975).

### How to add a normal map to geometry [16:53](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10202?time=1013)

1. Add an `Image` node and input the normal map.
2. Use a `Remap` node to adjust normal range from 0:1 to -1:1 if needed.

### How to dynamically animate between geometry modifiers [17:26](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10202?time=1046)

![Schematic of how to use the mix node to animate between geometry modifiers.][mix-node]

[mix-node]: ../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10202/mix-node.png

1. Add `Mix` nodes to blend between 2 sets of texture maps.
2. Add and connect a `Constant` to the `Mix` nodes, and set the value between 0:1 to control which texture set is shown.
3. Right click the `Constant` node, and convert it using the Promote command.
4. Dynamically animate inside your Swift code. Walk-through of this step can be found in the session [Work with Reality Composer Pro content in Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10273).
