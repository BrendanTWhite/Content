## About pre-orders

- When you make your app available for pre-order, its product page becomes published on the App Store. The app can be purchased before it's released for download.
- On release day, your customers will be notified and your app will be automatically downloaded on their devices.

## What's new

- Ability to offer your app for pre-order on a regional basis.
- You can also first release your app to a few regions, as a soft launch or limited release, and then offer your app for pre-order in any other region you choose.
