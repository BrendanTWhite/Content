# Reality Composer Pro
Reality Composer Pro is a developer tool for preparing RealityKit content to be used in your spatial computing app.

I'd recommend you familiarize yourself with the editor UI and features of Reality Composer Pro covered in the sessions:

We're looking at a topographical map of Yosemite National Park.

Here, we've added a slider to morph between two different California landmarks. Now we're looking at Catalina Island off the coast of Los Angeles.

We also have hovering 2D SwiftUI buttons positioned in 3D space that let you learn more about various points of interest in that map. 

# Load 3D content

In the above sessions, we made a Reality Composer Pro project that contains all the assets for our diorama arranged the way we want them. These tabs at the top each represent one root entity that we can load at runtime. We can put a lot of things into a scene and treat that as our fully assembled scene. Or we can put just a few and then treat that scene like a little reusable assemblage. We can make as many as we want. Let's see how we load this scene named DioramaAssembled at runtime. 


We use entity's asynchronous initializer to make us an entity with the contents from our Reality Composer Pro package.
```swift
let entity = try await Entity(named: "DioramaAssembled", in: realityKitContentBundle)
```

We specify which entity we want to load using its string name, and we give it the bundle that our package produces. It will throw if it can't find anything in our Reality Composer Pro project by that name. realityKitContentBundle is a constant value that we autogenerate for you in your Reality Composer Pro package. This goes in a RealityView make closure. A RealityView is a new kind of SwiftUI view.  
It's the bridge between the worlds of SwiftUI and RealityKit.

```swift
RealityView { content in
	do {
		let entity = try await Entity(named: "DioramaAssembled", in: realityKitContentBundle)
		content.add(entity)
	} catch {
		// Handle error
	}
}
```
