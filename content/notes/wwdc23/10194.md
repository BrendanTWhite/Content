## What are Live Activities?

- Use rich graphical layouts to display their information and update seamlessly inline
- On the lock screen, Live Activities live at the top of the list alongside notifications

Anything someone wants to keep track of for a few minutes to a couple hours can be a Live Activity

Examples:

### Lock Screen Design Tips

<img src="../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10194/1-lock-screen-margins.jpg">

- Be aware of 14pt margins added to all notifications.
---

- Try not to replicate the notification layouts themselves. Rather, create a layout that is unique and specific to the information you are displaying.
- Buttons should only be used if they're controlling an essential part of the activity itself
---

- Best result is when your Live Activity and app feel like they share the same visual aesthetic and personality
	- Consider the colors, iconography, typefaces, and other attributes from your app that you can use
	- Don't alter your colors between light and dark mode if it breaks this visual association

- You can also change the colors based on the content that it's representing to create a more dynamic and engaging visual of your information.

- If you do use a logo mark as part of your brand, make sure it's integrated uncontained into the layout itself rather than just using your whole app icon
---

- The background and foreground colors your Live Activity provides are used to automatically generate a matching dismiss button when swiping
	- Make sure to check that the resulting button looks correct
---
### Spacing

IMPORTANT: Ensure your Live Activities are not too tall, since this area is shared with notifications, music player, etc

<img src="../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10194/7-grow-and-shrink.jpg">

- Look for ways to reduce the height of your design by adjusting the size and placement of elements so they can better fit together and be more compact.
- Dynamically change the height of your Live Activity between different moments as you have more or less information to display.
---
### Transitions

- Use the numeric content transition to count up or down important numbers in your Activity.
- For animating in and out graphic elements and text, use the content replace transition.
- You can also create your own by combining different animations of the scale, opacity, and position of elements.

### Alerting

- Do not send secondary notifications to alert user of something related to your Live Activity, instead use your Live Activity
	- Alerting lights up the screen and plays the standard notification sound
	- Emphasize the information that caused the alert in your layout during this transition.

### Removal

- If your Live Activity has ended and is no longer relevant, make sure to remove it from the lock screen after a short duration of time

## Standby Design Tips

<img src="../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10194/8-standby.jpg">

- Standby is a new feature that lets you use your iPhone as an ambient informational display. 
- Your layout is scaled up 200% to maximize its size
	- Ensure assets and images you are using in your design are high enough resolution to be displayed at this larger size
---
<img src="../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10194/9-avoid-edge-styling.jpg">

- Avoid using graphic elements that extend to the edge of your Live Activity, use dividing lines or a containing shape instead
---
<img src="../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10194/10-remove-background.jpg">

- When in Standby mode, consider removing your background and blend your layout seamlessly into the device bezel
---
<img src="../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10194/11-night-mode.jpg">

- Live Activities in SandBy automatically gain "night mode" that transitions the display to a red tint in low light.
	- Check to make sure your colors have enough contrast while in night mode

## Dynamic Island Design Tips

<img src="../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10194/12-dynamic-island.jpg">

- Use of animation and continuously updating data here makes it feel more alive
- Extra rounded, thicker shapes, as well as large, heavier weight, easy-to-read text works well
- Use color to convey identity
---
<img src="../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10194/13-concentric-shape.jpg">

- Dynamic Island is very sensitive to the shape and placement of things inside it. It’s really important to place objects and information in it in a way that stays in harmony with this shape.
	- Be concentric with its shape. This is when rounded shapes nest inside of each other with even margins all the way around.

### Different Size Classes

#### Compact View

<img src="../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10194/14-compact-view.jpg">

- Compact is most common. Used help people keep an eye on an Activity while using their phone.
- It’s meant to be informational, communicating the most essential things about an activity
	- When you want to show multiple sessions for your app going on at once, consider ticking between the display of them
---
<img src="../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10194/15-snug.jpg">

- Be as narrow as possible with no wasted space.
- Ensure content is snug against the sensor region.
---
<img src="../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10194/16-alerts.jpg">

- If you need to alert users of an event during your session, rather than sending a push notification, when possible, expand the island to present that information
---
#### Expanded View

<img src="../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10194/17-expanded-view.jpg">

- In addition to alerting you, people can press into the Dynamic Island to zoom into this view and see more information, and access essential controls.
- Try to get to the essence of your activity here, not showing too little or too much.
- Emphasize rounded, thicker shapes, and a liberal use of color to establish identity.
---
<img src="../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10194/18-cohesive-style.jpg">

- Try and maintain the relative placement of things between the expanded/compact views for cohesiveness.
---
<img src="../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10194/19-expanded-tallness.jpg">

- Try to keep the tallness of your expanded view within reason
- Avoid having a “forehead” at the top that calls attention to the sensor region
---
#### Minimal View

<img src="../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10194/20-minimal-view.jpg">

- This view is shown when juggling between multiple sessions going on at once
---
<img src="../../../images/notes/wwdc23/10194/21-minimal-show-data.jpg">

- Avoid reverting to purely just a logo here, and think about how your session can continue to convey information even in this tiny state.
