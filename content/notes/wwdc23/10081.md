Refresher: 
- **Entities** are container objects.
- **Components** define specific behavior on entities.
- **Systems** act on both entities and components to add functionality.
- **RealityView** is an API that acts as a bridge between SwiftUI and RealityKit

## How to embed SwiftUI views into RealityKit content using attachments in RealityView [02:05](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10081?time=125)

> Attachments are a useful way to embed SwiftUI content into your RealityKit scene.

[Example app that demonstrates how to put text labels and views alongside 3D content using attachment views](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10081?time=147).

**2 parts to settings up attachments**
1. Add the parameter in the make closure of your RealityView
2. Include the attachments view builder to your RealityView

The **attachments view builder** is where you can provide SwiftUI views that you want to add to your RealityKit content. You can then tag those views and call them as entities **inside your make closure** using the call `entity(for:)`.

You can also update entities inside of the update closure whenever there are changes to SwiftUI view state.

## How to add Video Playback in RealityKit scenes [06:17](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10081?time=377)

`VideoPlayerComponent` is a new component type in RealityKit used for embedding video content inside a 3D scene.
- _Reminder: components define behavior that you attach to entities_.

**To play a video using `VideoPlayerComponent`**:
1. Load a video file from resources bundle
2. Create an `AVPlayer` instance
3. Create a `VideoPlayerComponent`
4. Attach component to an entity

**insert image** ?

- Since RealityKit is a 3D framework, video is represented as an entity with a mesh so that you can move and position it in 3D space.
- `VideoPlayerComponent` also supports **Passthrough Tinting** by setting the `isPassthroughTintingEnabled` property to true.
- You can also subscribe to `VideoPlayerEvents` by calling the subscribe function inside RealityViews content, and specifying the event type and entity [10:39](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10081?time=639).

## How to use Portals [11:06](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10081?time=666)

**Portals** create openings to other worlds that are visible through mesh surfaces. Entities inside of these worlds use separate lighting, and are masked by portal geometry.

- Basically there's a separate component called `World` which is what you use in portals and I think is the only way to render portals
- Lighting is unique and can learn more in another session

## How to use the Particle Emitters API [15:04](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10081?time=904)

`ParticleEmitterComponent` provided in RealityKit can be created either Reality Composer Pro or via RealityKit at runtime.
