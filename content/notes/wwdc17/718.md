Currently iPhone supports only *reading* NFC, they can’t write to NFC tags (this changed from iOS 13, any iPhone from 7 and later can write).

To use Core NFC capabilities we need to:

- enable its entitlement.
- add a usage description in the `info.plist`

How to read:  
The app has to start a “tag reading session”, which will be valid as long as the app stays in the foreground with the NFC UI visible (see below). Each session has a 60 seconds lifespan, after which a new session has to be started.

Two modes:

- Single Tag: the session aims to read one tag and will end as soon as any tag is read.
- Multiple Tags Session: the session will continue even after reading one or more tags (up to 60s).

NFC UI:
