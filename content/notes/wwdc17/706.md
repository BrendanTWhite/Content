- Create a small amount of queues. **One queue per subsystem is recommended.** For example, database queue, network queue.
- Do not create a large number of queues, use target_queue to set up queue hierarchy instead. 
- **Do not change priority, target_queue nor qos**, after queue is created. It changes queue behavior, which then turn off all optimizations.
- Too many work submitted to a concurrent queue, can cause **thread explosion**. Solve this by using a serial queue instead.
- Taking advantages of parallelization, divide work into multiple chunks. Too small chunk, more context switching overhead. Too large chunk, less CPU utilization (more cpu idle time). Size your work appropriately.
- Choose good granularity of concurrency
