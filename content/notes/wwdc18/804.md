- Very design focused talk on how we should place a single button to the screen. The topics range from what a button is, how the user perceives it, placement, feedback, what should happen when the user is tapping on it and after
- It also discusses about adding sound to the button:
  - Not all buttons need sound
  - Sounds must be familiar across the app and recognizable
  - Sounds must have a purpose
