- Four types of custom responses:
  - Confirm (e.g. confirm you want to book a ride)
  - Success (let the user know that the action the user asked has been done successfully, like your order is completed)
  - Information (e.g. provide weather forecast, transit directions, etc)
  - Error (let the user know what went wrong)
- For the custom responses you can define custom properties (data from your app) and template
- Intent UI Extensions are awesome (check out [What’s new in Sirikit][wwdc17214])
- When you donate a `NSUserActivity` instance, you can specify title (this should represent what actions is taken when the user runs it, be super concise), subtitle (more info, you can also use the custom properties here as well), image and suggested invocation phrase
- You can even create suggested intentions: the user will find these in the settings even if the user never took one of these in the app
- You can present an action “Add to Siri” within your app (basically: import IntentsUI, INIUIAddVoiceShortcutViewController(shortcut: shortcut) and present it)
- You can also present a (system) ViewController showing the current Intents added to Siri
