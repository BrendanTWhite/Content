- Swift protocols for collections represent a good starting point for thinking about collection operations in swift.
- Numerous types conform to these protocols (IndexPaths, Data etc..)
- Slicing and Lazy collections represent optimizations and deferred operations but understanding the underlying memory semantics is important.
- Mutable collections should be avoided and holding onto calculated indexes inherently dangerous when dealing with mutable collections
- Need to work with Thread Sanitizer TSAN more.
- Collections are optimized for single thread access (but thread safe right?)
- Bridging between objective-c and swift can affect performance. Look for bridge api calls and perf in Time Profiler. 
- NS~Collection types (ref type) vs Swift collections. 
- Use foundation collections (`NS..`)  when you reference semantics and the elements are known to be reference types.
