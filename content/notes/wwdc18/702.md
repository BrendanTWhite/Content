Background Tag Reading! Only from iPhone Xs line up.

## Requirements

- The NFC needs to have a universal link associated with it, so the phone can understand which apps to open.
- By default Safari will process the NFC tags with universal links to apps not in the device.

## Availability

Anytime the screen is on except:

- Device has never been unlicked
- Core NFC reader session is active
- Apple Wallet in use
- Video camera in use
- Airplane mode

## How to manage the tag delivery in your app.

Like any other `NSUserActivity` instance, via the `appDelegate` `application(_:continue:restorationHandler:)`.

Access the `ndefMessagePayload` property of the `NSUserActivity`.

For universal link, we need to register the Associated Domains in the app capabilities.
