- Backward compatible with “old” workflow (a.k.a, you can still import just the `.xliff` files as usual)
- Xcode 10 export function now exports a “localization artifact” with `.xcloc` extension (**XC**ode **LO**calization **C**atalog), one file per language
- This `.xcloc` file, beside the usual `.xliff`, also includes anything that is marked as localizable in the app (like image assets and more), and also provides additional contextual information (to help the translator make better translations).
- `.cxloc` architecture:
![][Image]

- In the “Notes” folder we can drop whatever we want (screenshots, videos, ..)
- The “Source Contents” folder mimics the our project folder structure and includes the original language we’ve build our app with (it includes storyboards)
- Can localize Intents (for Siri Shortcuts) and responses
