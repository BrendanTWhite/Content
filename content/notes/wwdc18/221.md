- TextKit is a special framework that sits between UIKit/AppKit and CoreText
![][textKitStackImage]
- In case you’re in doubt on which UIKit element you need:
![][decisionChartImage]
- ..and for AppKit:
![][decisionChartAppKitImage]
- If we have a lot of text do format, `UITextView` has a `allowsNonContiguousLayout` property that will format the text only when it is visualized, therefore not requiring the whole text to be formatted before displaying to the user (requires the `UITextView`’s scrolling to be enabled, otherwise asking for the intrinsic size of the `UITextView` will need to format the whole text before returning)
- For security, all text input is potentially untrusted. Therefore before processing any input (what happens if a user pastes a 3M+ words book in our text input?) we should take a look at `UITextFieldDelegate` (UIKit) and `NSFormatter` (AppKit).
