Lots of performance improvements (both within `UIKit` and also at app level).

## Render Loop

The Render Loop is the process that runs potentially at **120** times every  second (if your screen is `120Hz`). That makes sure that all the content is ready to go for each frame.

The Render Loop consists of three phases: 

- Update Constraints
- Layout
- Display

![][renderLoopImage]

### Update Constraints

- Runs from the leaf most views up to the view hierarchy towards the window.

### Layout (sub layouts)

- Runs the opposite direction starting from the window going down towards the leaves.

### Display

- Every view gets drawn (if necessary) from window going down

## Autolayout

- It is suggested to use interface builder as much as possible to avoid auto layout performance issues
- Interesting behind the scenes of what happens when we activate a new constraint from 12:00 - 17:00
- Don’t avoid using constraints
- Don’t wedge two layouts into one set of constraints: it creates a lot of false dependencies, and is difficult to debug
E.g.: final layout:
![][finalImage]
When actually it should have been two different layouts:
![][betterImage]

- When in need to change the layout, never remove all the constraints and add them back, change only the necessary ones.
- If a view doesn’t interact with the surrounding views, instead of adding it and removing it (along with its constraints), it’s much better to hide it (isHidden = true)
- If you have shared constraints among your different layouts, initialize them once and never touch them again

## Cost of constraints

- Inequality: very little
- Constant: none
- Priority: needs some amount of work 

How to measure? Instruments for Layout!

## `systemLayoutSizeFitting`

`systemLayoutSizeFitting:` is expensive, as everytime the followings need to execute:
